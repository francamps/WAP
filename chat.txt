Jan 28, 2014, 10:11 AM - Sonia Maria: Slept it off
Jan 28, 2014, 10:11 AM - Sonia Maria: Was being a bit dramatic there
Jan 28, 2014, 10:11 AM - Sonia Maria: All good now
Jan 28, 2014, 10:26 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Nice :) You basically just needed to rest
Jan 28, 2014, 3:36 PM - Sonia Maria: Definitely
Jan 28, 2014, 3:39 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I was literally writing to you
Jan 28, 2014, 3:39 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Arnau is playing on Friday
Jan 28, 2014, 3:39 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Wanna go?
Jan 28, 2014, 4:48 PM - Sonia Maria: Cool, what time is it?
Jan 28, 2014, 4:49 PM - Sonia Maria: I'm down
Jan 28, 2014, 4:50 PM - Sonia Maria: My friend will be spinning that night as well but I was/still am unsure if I will go
Jan 28, 2014, 4:56 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I don't know, but it should be done not too late
Jan 28, 2014, 4:56 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Maybe both things are doable
Jan 28, 2014, 5:10 PM - Sonia Maria: Truth
Jan 28, 2014, 5:11 PM - Sonia Maria: We'll see
Jan 28, 2014, 5:59 PM - Sonia Maria: Have you made any plans for this weekend
Jan 28, 2014, 6:07 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Not really
Jan 28, 2014, 6:15 PM - Sonia Maria: Ok cool. There's a group dinner w a few zero people on Sunday eve. It's in Bushwick. Just wanted to pass an invite
Jan 28, 2014, 6:17 PM - Sonia Maria: :)
Jan 28, 2014, 10:01 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Sorry, I've just left the office. Kind of a crazy day
Jan 28, 2014, 10:01 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Yeah, sure, sounds fun
Jan 28, 2014, 10:01 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Whose place is it?
Jan 28, 2014, 10:22 PM - Sonia Maria: Jamie
Jan 28, 2014, 10:23 PM - Sonia Maria: Sounds like a long day
Jan 28, 2014, 11:00 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Yeah, but not too bad
Jan 28, 2014, 11:01 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I've been offered to transfer to London in March
Jan 28, 2014, 11:01 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Like, to move there
Jan 28, 2014, 11:02 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I'm thinking about it, but most likely I'll say no. We'll see.
Jan 28, 2014, 11:10 PM - Sonia Maria: Same position, salary, etc.? I imagine there will be a slight pay cut, not that it actually matters. London is such a dynamic city, professionally and personally. I wouldn't be so dismissive about it if I were you. I'm speaking in a complete non-critical sense obviously.
Jan 29, 2014, 7:59 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: It'd be quite a different position actually, closer to project management and bd and maybe there'd a bit of a cut. Let's talk when I see you, I need first hand information :)
Jan 29, 2014, 11:21 AM - Sonia Maria: Hmm yeah, better to discuss when I see you
Jan 29, 2014, 12:36 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: :D what day is the ballet?
Jan 29, 2014, 12:40 PM - Sonia Maria: Next Friday
Jan 29, 2014, 12:47 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Cool. My friend was telling me about a party that night, but it'll be later I imagine
Jan 29, 2014, 1:57 PM - Sonia Maria: Shouldn't conflict with anything as the show is at 730, runs for about 2 hours
Jan 29, 2014, 3:15 PM - Sonia Maria: ^ I lied. Starts at 8. What I last said still applies though
Jan 29, 2014, 3:15 PM - Sonia Maria: *what I first said
Jan 29, 2014, 4:02 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Yeah, no problem
Jan 29, 2014, 4:04 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Johb Talabot djs at that party, it'd be nice to see him, but it'll go late enough anyway
Jan 29, 2014, 4:34 PM - Sonia Maria: Cool. Well it's a dance party. So yeah.
Jan 29, 2014, 4:50 PM - Sonia Maria: In any case, if there's an issue w you coming just give me a shout, cause I'm going regardless
Jan 29, 2014, 5:08 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: No, no, no! Sorry, I didn't mean to sound like I'm not going
Jan 29, 2014, 5:08 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I'm super in
Jan 29, 2014, 5:08 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: In the case they conflict, I'd rather miss the party
Jan 29, 2014, 5:12 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: By far
Jan 29, 2014, 5:53 PM - Sonia Maria: Cool cool
Jan 30, 2014, 1:18 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: It turns out Julien got that job he did an interview for a couple weeks ago. You can be as loud as you want next time ;)
Jan 30, 2014, 2:28 PM - Sonia Maria: Haha, well that's doubly good news
Jan 30, 2014, 3:05 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: You up to sth today?
Jan 30, 2014, 3:06 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I may go with friends to LIC see some exhibition by my friend's friend
Jan 30, 2014, 3:21 PM - Sonia Maria: Well I free up around 8. What time is the exhibition?
Jan 30, 2014, 3:23 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I think it starts then
Jan 30, 2014, 3:23 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: My friends won't be there until a bit later.
Jan 30, 2014, 3:36 PM - Sonia Maria: Cool. Well I'll keep you posted. Are you going straight from work?
Jan 30, 2014, 3:47 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Maybe, not sure yet. I may go home early and then go out
Jan 30, 2014, 4:18 PM - Sonia Maria: Ok
Jan 30, 2014, 7:46 PM - Sonia Maria: Have you decided whether you are going?
Jan 30, 2014, 7:46 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Hey

Jan 30, 2014, 7:49 PM - Sonia Maria: Ok. On NYU campus now, heading back to Bushwick. Was trying to figure out what I'm going to do
Jan 30, 2014, 7:54 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I'd like to see you anyways
Jan 30, 2014, 8:16 PM - Sonia Maria: Same, in Bushwick now. Let me know what you decide. Though I really want to, I have a super early start tomo and just v tired, so don't think I can join for LIC
Jan 30, 2014, 8:18 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I'm not going in the end, my friend told it wasn't worth it
Jan 30, 2014, 8:19 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Don't worry, I understant
Jan 30, 2014, 8:19 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: understand
Jan 30, 2014, 8:19 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Let's talk tomorrow
Jan 30, 2014, 8:20 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Have a good night of sleep tonighy
Jan 30, 2014, 8:25 PM - Sonia Maria: I kind of want to see you so I'd be down to just kick it. Just meant that I wasn't keen on going to to LIC.
Jan 30, 2014, 8:26 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: What's "kick it"?
Jan 30, 2014, 8:26 PM - Sonia Maria: Chill...

Jan 30, 2014, 8:31 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: :)
Jan 30, 2014, 9:00 PM - Sonia Maria: Using a car service proved extremely ineffective
Jan 30, 2014, 9:01 PM - Sonia Maria: Reasons why I use uber
Jan 30, 2014, 9:11 PM - Sonia Maria: I'm outside

Feb 1, 2014, 7:02 PM - Sonia Maria: I found it a few months ago looking for photos. Then came across this coat and another and kept it. She brought over some clothes and stuff. And I have a leather already so, figured I'd show it to you

Feb 3, 2014, 11:14 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: How was the dinner?
Feb 3, 2014, 11:22 AM - Sonia Maria: Yes
Feb 3, 2014, 11:22 AM - Sonia Maria: It's not so bad
Feb 3, 2014, 11:23 AM - Sonia Maria: Just don't feel I've properly settled you know
Feb 3, 2014, 12:02 PM - Sonia Maria: I actually cancelled last minute. I wanted Alea (roommate) to come with and she didn't want to as she was feeling ill. I was also not in a mood to interact with others. You know, those type of days. So I just relaxed and picked up an obsession w the series Shameless.
Feb 3, 2014, 12:03 PM - Sonia Maria: Btw I recommend you watch it, the writing is pretty amazing
Feb 3, 2014, 12:51 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I was totally feeling the same way yesterday
Feb 3, 2014, 12:52 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Ended up not meeting w my friends and stayed home, where some of juliens friends were watching the superbowl
Feb 3, 2014, 12:52 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I was just antisocial and stayed in my room reading for the most part
Feb 3, 2014, 1:37 PM - Sonia Maria: Yeah, the Super Bowl is one of the top reasons why I hate America. And that sounds relaxing as well. Alone time is underrated, sometimes necessary

Feb 6, 2014, 10:46 AM - Sonia Maria: Hey what's up

Feb 8, 2014, 3:48 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I've actually called it off
Feb 8, 2014, 3:48 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Due to the lack of fucking subway
Feb 8, 2014, 3:49 PM - Sonia Maria: Yeah, super inconvenient
Feb 8, 2014, 3:49 PM - Sonia Maria: Let me know what you're up to before anyway
Feb 8, 2014, 3:57 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Maybe it's just a good idea to find a place in soho and have a massive collective brunner there
Feb 8, 2014, 3:57 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Or west village
Feb 8, 2014, 4:02 PM - Sonia Maria: I could do that
Feb 8, 2014, 4:02 PM - Sonia Maria: "Brunner"
Feb 8, 2014, 5:52 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Fucking NY, everything is too difficult to organize

Feb 13, 2014, 9:44 PM - Sonia Maria: If you do end up taking up Shameless as a side hobby as I have- you'll find that it makes your life seem kind of really decent / awesome
Feb 13, 2014, 9:44 PM - Sonia Maria: Mainly bc the life of that family is incredibly fucked up haha

Feb 14, 2014, 12:01 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Christ, how much are they charging you?
Feb 14, 2014, 12:02 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Can you at least spit or vomit in the car or something?
Feb 14, 2014, 12:04 AM - Sonia Maria: Ermmm I'll refrain on physical  abuse to taxi
Feb 14, 2014, 12:04 AM - Sonia Maria: I'm about to be outside of yours

Feb 14, 2014, 1:40 PM - Sonia Maria: It's beautiful out. I actually dialed in while in the taxi. So I was on time - could've just done that initially. Wasn't thinking clearly
Feb 14, 2014, 1:58 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Haha you could have totally done that from my house
Feb 14, 2014, 1:58 PM - Sonia Maria: Right? And my wifi is fucked up at my apartment so I m at a cafe now. Bleh
Feb 14, 2014, 2:03 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Haha oh well, I love working from cafes
Feb 14, 2014, 2:08 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: You're going to Jodie's right?

Feb 14, 2014, 2:09 PM - Sonia Maria: You?
Feb 14, 2014, 2:13 PM - Sonia Maria: I have to give you your gift
Feb 14, 2014, 2:48 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Is that really a thing? Or you're just kidding me?
Feb 14, 2014, 2:48 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Either way, I won't get mad, I promise :)
Feb 14, 2014, 3:19 PM - Sonia Maria: Haha, was joking. I can't deal with any of that cheesy shit. I just say it to get a rise out of you. For fun real quick
Feb 14, 2014, 4:06 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I still want to fuck you tonight, for reasons compleyely unrelated to Valentine's day.
Feb 14, 2014, 4:06 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: No cheesiness involved ;)
Feb 14, 2014, 4:25 PM - Sonia Maria: Right. Definitely happening. To be honest I was going to ask for a play date before Jodie's
Feb 14, 2014, 4:26 PM - Sonia Maria: I think that would impede on night plans tho
Feb 14, 2014, 8:39 PM - Sonia Maria: What time are you going to Jodie's

Feb 17, 2014, 1:22 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I need to get out of here
Feb 17, 2014, 1:23 PM - Sonia Maria: About?
Feb 17, 2014, 1:24 PM - Sonia Maria: Put your noise canceling headphones in :)
Feb 17, 2014, 1:24 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Some guy who acts childish
Feb 17, 2014, 1:24 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: And thinks that she wants something she doesnt really want
Feb 17, 2014, 1:25 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: And there all these communication issues
Feb 17, 2014, 1:25 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: And he is always at the same bar, which is also her regular bar
Feb 17, 2014, 1:25 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: And she feels that she can't really go there anymore
Feb 17, 2014, 1:26 PM - Sonia Maria: That sounds like it belongs in an episode of Girls. *vomit*
Feb 17, 2014, 1:26 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Because it looks like she's asking for it
Feb 17, 2014, 1:27 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: They are super Girls-like
Feb 17, 2014, 1:29 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: 
Feb 17, 2014, 1:33 PM - Sonia Maria: Politely ask them to shut the fuck up and then smile
Feb 17, 2014, 1:34 PM - Sonia Maria: It's cynical enough to work
Feb 17, 2014, 1:38 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: That would be so amazing
Feb 17, 2014, 2:22 PM - Sonia Maria: I've side tracked on work a bit and started sorting out my vacation days- Fuck the American corporate system and how little vacation days I'm given.
Feb 17, 2014, 2:22 PM - Sonia Maria: Colleagues of mine are given 2x as much time in UK and CH. I'm crying inside
Feb 17, 2014, 5:08 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: That's really fucked up. Even as a swiss company? How many days do you get?
Feb 17, 2014, 6:28 PM - Sonia Maria: Yes, bc I'm based in US I only get 15 days whereas European colleagues get 33. System is entirely fucked.
Feb 17, 2014, 6:28 PM - Sonia Maria: Bleh, done complaining
Feb 17, 2014, 6:29 PM - Sonia Maria: Hope your day was filled with sunshine and productivity :) hah
Feb 17, 2014, 6:44 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: You will have to start planning movng to Europe then :D
Feb 17, 2014, 6:44 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: My day was 0 productivity, all sunshine
Feb 17, 2014, 6:44 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: And a lot of errans in the afternoon :P
Feb 17, 2014, 7:09 PM - Sonia Maria: Will have to find some solution to this
Feb 17, 2014, 7:09 PM - Sonia Maria: And yeah, I took advantage of the day
Feb 17, 2014, 7:10 PM - Sonia Maria: Working now
Feb 19, 2014, 2:37 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Do you think this is racist?
Feb 19, 2014, 2:37 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: <Media omitted>
Feb 19, 2014, 2:38 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: The show looks pretty racist to me, but I'm curious to know what you think
Feb 19, 2014, 2:49 PM - Sonia Maria: This is beyond racist. But also beyond stupid. Mainly because I have a good friend from the south and she comes from a rather affluent African American family.
Feb 19, 2014, 2:50 PM - Sonia Maria: I only see white people. Now I'm looking into the show- and it's based in North Carolina.
Feb 19, 2014, 2:50 PM - Sonia Maria: Fucking hell
Feb 19, 2014, 2:52 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Right. It looks like it's even made on purpose to be racist. It looks colonial, pre abolition of slavery, but modernized
Feb 19, 2014, 2:53 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: It's quite disgusting
Feb 19, 2014, 2:53 PM - Sonia Maria: This actually bothers me so much for some reason
Feb 19, 2014, 2:56 PM - Sonia Maria: But to be honest in the world of reality TV- this kind of BS sells hard
Feb 19, 2014, 8:44 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Hey, are you out?
Feb 19, 2014, 9:05 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: My dinner is gonna finish relatively soon, in case you want to meet up
Feb 19, 2014, 9:07 PM - Sonia Maria: I'm on my way to meet a friend
Feb 19, 2014, 9:08 PM - Sonia Maria: You in city or bk?

Feb 19, 2014, 9:20 PM - Sonia Maria: Going to cafe select. Off Laff and spring.
Feb 19, 2014, 9:24 PM - Sonia Maria: In case you were wondering- it is as pretentious as it sounds
Feb 19, 2014, 9:30 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Haha yeah I've been there
Feb 19, 2014, 10:17 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I'm out of the restaurant

Feb 19, 2014, 11:30 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I'm getting home now
Feb 20, 2014, 12:05 AM - Sonia Maria: I'm about to head back to BK mow
Feb 20, 2014, 12:06 AM - Sonia Maria: *now

Feb 20, 2014, 12:06 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Haha
Feb 20, 2014, 12:06 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: You can come over if you want
Feb 20, 2014, 12:10 AM - Sonia Maria: 'Mow' should be a definitive financial term for all females traveling from manhattan to Brooklyn
Feb 20, 2014, 12:12 AM - Sonia Maria: Rant over
Feb 20, 2014, 12:22 AM - Sonia Maria: Are you still awake

Feb 21, 2014, 8:30 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Hey, sorry I was asleep and left my phone charging in the living room
Feb 21, 2014, 9:00 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Let's talk for later today or tmw

Feb 24, 2014, 10:10 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I suspect this article is going to make me sad
Feb 24, 2014, 11:39 AM - Sonia Maria: Yes
Feb 24, 2014, 11:39 AM - Sonia Maria: Most likely will
Feb 24, 2014, 12:16 PM - Sonia Maria: This is the last one and I'm done for today
Feb 24, 2014, 12:16 PM - Sonia Maria: http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bourghetto
Feb 24, 2014, 12:25 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Hahahaha how did you even find that? Did you actually google ghetto bourgois?
Feb 24, 2014, 12:55 PM - Sonia Maria: Haha, guilty. I actually just used urban dictionary
Feb 24, 2014, 12:56 PM - Sonia Maria: As I wanted to see if this term has been used
Feb 24, 2014, 12:56 PM - Sonia Maria: And it has
Feb 24, 2014, 12:58 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I feel like its kind of the opposite as what I meant though
Feb 24, 2014, 12:58 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: By the way, the article is not that terrible
Feb 24, 2014, 12:58 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: The basic terrible thing is that the NYT is talking about Berlin as a trendy thing
Feb 24, 2014, 1:01 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: But the content is alright
Feb 24, 2014, 1:06 PM - Sonia Maria: That's why I found it funny, though I do have some hood like tendencies.
Feb 24, 2014, 1:06 PM - Sonia Maria: And I also did like the article, especially in describing nightlife in NYC vs Berlin
Feb 24, 2014, 1:12 PM - Sonia Maria: But the article kind of shows what tends to happen to things when "Americans" start to set their footprints on something, wouldn't you agree?
Feb 24, 2014, 1:12 PM - Sonia Maria: Like, it can't just be. Has to e publicized as something
Feb 24, 2014, 1:24 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Yeah, agree. The last time I was there I was surprised by how English was becoming so vehicular
Feb 24, 2014, 1:24 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: But I also worry that a NY way of doing business is being imported
Feb 24, 2014, 1:25 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: And that Berlin will lose it's character towards direction instead of becoming its own thing
Feb 24, 2014, 1:25 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: *towards that direction
Feb 24, 2014, 3:16 PM - Sonia Maria: That's what I was leaning towards with what I said- it's kind of signaling that something will be lost / lose it's authenticity because of this. I couldn't pinpoint whether it would be economy, culture, a mix of both, etc.
Feb 24, 2014, 11:08 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I just finished The black power mixtape
Feb 24, 2014, 11:09 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Good stuff
Feb 24, 2014, 11:09 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: We'll talk about it
Feb 25, 2014, 12:01 AM - Sonia Maria: Nice, looking forward to hearing what you thought about it. Last night was my third time seeing the docu
Feb 25, 2014, 12:02 AM - Sonia Maria: I also read the gawker article you sent me
Feb 25, 2014, 12:06 AM - Sonia Maria: My reaction: "meh"
Feb 25, 2014, 12:24 AM - Sonia Maria: Although I did skim the comments after and reader's thoughts on the new "cool" city were either intriguing or laughable
Feb 25, 2014, 5:34 PM - Sonia Maria: Hey
Feb 25, 2014, 5:34 PM - Sonia Maria: Have you got plans this eve?
Feb 25, 2014, 6:10 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Heya
Feb 25, 2014, 6:11 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Im afraid I'll be leaving work kinda late today
Feb 25, 2014, 6:11 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Not sure exactly
Feb 25, 2014, 6:11 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: But not soon
Feb 25, 2014, 6:12 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I can hit you up later, when I know, see what you're up to
Feb 25, 2014, 7:11 PM - Sonia Maria: Yeah, give me a shout
Feb 25, 2014, 7:13 PM - Sonia Maria: I refrained from saying "holla at me", suppressing the inner ghetto in me
Feb 25, 2014, 7:24 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Hahaha
Feb 25, 2014, 8:20 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Heading out now
Feb 25, 2014, 8:46 PM - Sonia Maria: Heading home? I'm having quick dinner now. Chris Spearpoint is having a bday thing at bossa nova, I think I will stop by for a few as it is close to mine.
Feb 25, 2014, 8:55 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Yeah, I just got to bedstuy. Not sure I'll be going out though. Maybe.
Feb 25, 2014, 8:55 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I guess most likely not
Feb 25, 2014, 8:56 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Because I would have to bike and meh
Feb 25, 2014, 9:04 PM - Sonia Maria: It's cold out
Feb 25, 2014, 9:11 PM - Sonia Maria: Don't think I have the energy to go
Feb 25, 2014, 9:27 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: You should go
Feb 25, 2014, 9:27 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: It really is kind of close
Feb 25, 2014, 9:31 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: If you end up going let me know what you're up to and if you want to meet up later
Feb 25, 2014, 9:32 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: And if you dont, just come over
Feb 25, 2014, 9:32 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: :)
Feb 25, 2014, 10:21 PM - Sonia Maria: I've decided to stop by briefly
Feb 25, 2014, 10:21 PM - Sonia Maria: Will hit you up in a few
Feb 25, 2014, 10:26 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Cool
Feb 25, 2014, 10:29 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I'm gonna go to sleep soon, so if you want to stay longer let me know, we can meet tmw or sth otherwise
Feb 25, 2014, 10:52 PM - Sonia Maria: Ok. I will just message you when I approach time to leave and see if you are awake. Tomo eve actually works better for me in any case. So we will coordinate
Feb 26, 2014, 12:13 AM - Sonia Maria: Don't want to inconvenience you, but if you're still up then I want to come meet you.
Feb 26, 2014, 7:26 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Mierda. I think I fell asleep like 5 minutes before this.
Feb 26, 2014, 10:39 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Would you be down for the Miyazaki movie tonight?
Feb 26, 2014, 10:51 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Also BurningMan tickets are going on sale today
Feb 26, 2014, 11:38 AM - Sonia Maria: My whatsapp has been acting like a bitch all morning
Feb 26, 2014, 11:38 AM - Sonia Maria: Blaming it on Facebook
Feb 26, 2014, 11:38 AM - Sonia Maria: And yeah, I am
Feb 26, 2014, 11:38 AM - Sonia Maria: Down
Feb 26, 2014, 11:42 AM - Sonia Maria: And tickets go on sale at noon, going to get one

Feb 26, 2014, 12:11 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Ok, I'll check on movie times
Feb 26, 2014, 12:25 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: 830pm sounds feasible at Landmark? You can come pick me up 7ish and we go from here?
Feb 26, 2014, 12:37 PM - Sonia Maria: That works :)
Feb 26, 2014, 3:01 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Get your BM ticket!
Feb 26, 2014, 3:06 PM - Sonia Maria: Thx for reminding
Feb 26, 2014, 3:18 PM - Sonia Maria: :/
Feb 26, 2014, 3:20 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: What's up?
Feb 26, 2014, 3:28 PM - Sonia Maria: Still waiting...
Feb 26, 2014, 3:45 PM - Sonia Maria: 

Feb 26, 2014, 3:48 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Yes!
Feb 26, 2014, 3:52 PM - Sonia Maria: :)
Feb 26, 2014, 3:56 PM - Sonia Maria: http://gothamist.com/2014/02/26/spike_lee_goes_off_about_the_mother.php
Feb 26, 2014, 3:56 PM - Sonia Maria: Fucking hipsters man
Feb 26, 2014, 4:13 PM - Sonia Maria: Also, BM tix seem to have sold out in first 50min. That's 760 tix/min. Insane. I mean there will be plenty on the market eventually. But, still...
Feb 26, 2014, 4:36 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Motherfucking hipsters man
Feb 26, 2014, 4:36 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Christ this week is being insane at work

Feb 26, 2014, 4:37 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Or at BM haha
Feb 26, 2014, 5:25 PM - Sonia Maria: This is a relatively slow week, so I can't complain. You'll be in warmth soon
Feb 26, 2014, 5:25 PM - Sonia Maria: :)
Feb 26, 2014, 5:46 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: It all looks like I'll be in Spain before Austin
Feb 26, 2014, 5:58 PM - Sonia Maria: !! When will you leave
Feb 26, 2014, 6:14 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Maybe Tuesday
Feb 26, 2014, 6:19 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Its all confusing and stressing
Feb 26, 2014, 6:31 PM - Sonia Maria: How so
Feb 26, 2014, 6:32 PM - Sonia Maria: Actually I'm seeing you soon, you can better explain then
Feb 26, 2014, 6:32 PM - Sonia Maria: 730 right?
Feb 26, 2014, 6:32 PM - Sonia Maria: I can be there a bit earlier actually
Feb 26, 2014, 6:33 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Come at 7, if you can
Feb 26, 2014, 6:33 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: That should work
Feb 26, 2014, 6:49 PM - Sonia Maria: On my way

Feb 26, 2014, 7:16 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I'll be down in a minute
Feb 26, 2014, 7:17 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I think we exchanged contacts, btw
Feb 26, 2014, 7:18 PM - Sonia Maria: Hmm really I haven't felt a change
Feb 26, 2014, 7:21 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Is your left eye better than your right?
Feb 27, 2014, 10:40 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: How are you feeling?
Feb 27, 2014, 11:48 AM - Sonia Maria: I'm fine
Feb 27, 2014, 11:49 AM - Sonia Maria: Was in a funk this morning, all good now :)
Feb 27, 2014, 3:12 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: It looks like I'll be leaving on Friday finally
Feb 27, 2014, 3:12 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: And not going to London
Feb 27, 2014, 3:12 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: It should all be easier like that
Feb 27, 2014, 3:47 PM - Sonia Maria: That's not bad
Feb 27, 2014, 3:47 PM - Sonia Maria: So you'll be going to Barcelona and Madrid
Feb 27, 2014, 3:47 PM - Sonia Maria: ?
Feb 27, 2014, 3:48 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Yeah
Feb 27, 2014, 3:49 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Much easier
Feb 27, 2014, 3:59 PM - Sonia Maria: Less stress now
Feb 27, 2014, 3:59 PM - Sonia Maria: Are you still coming to NY before Austin?
Feb 27, 2014, 4:00 PM - Sonia Maria: *coming back
Feb 27, 2014, 4:10 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Yes, for a day
Feb 27, 2014, 4:56 PM - Sonia Maria: Dope
Feb 27, 2014, 4:56 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Im spending all day listening to soul
Feb 27, 2014, 4:56 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Im listening to dwele now
Feb 27, 2014, 4:56 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Haha
Feb 27, 2014, 4:57 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I dont know whats happening to me
Feb 27, 2014, 4:57 PM - Sonia Maria: Aha I love dwele. I'm having one of my ignorant rap music days.
Feb 27, 2014, 4:58 PM - Sonia Maria: So I'm probably more confused than you are right now
Feb 27, 2014, 5:00 PM - Sonia Maria: Aloe blacc - find a way
Feb 27, 2014, 5:15 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Nice :)
Feb 27, 2014, 5:15 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Let me send an awesome obscure record
Feb 28, 2014, 10:59 AM - Sonia Maria: Had to move my appt to next Wednesday - made an early appointment but I have a client meeting I can't get out of
Feb 28, 2014, 11:00 AM - Sonia Maria: Hope all turned out well for you

Feb 28, 2014, 2:51 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Apparently I won't know until Tuesday actually :P
Feb 28, 2014, 2:51 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Plans for tonight/weekend?
Feb 28, 2014, 3:29 PM - Sonia Maria: Hmm ok, I never heard of such a long wait
Feb 28, 2014, 3:29 PM - Sonia Maria: And nothing heavy
Feb 28, 2014, 3:30 PM - Sonia Maria: http://flavorpill.com/events/buzzchips-and-all-things-go-present-body-language-with-joywave-the-echo-friendly-jamaican-queens rsvp'd to that
Feb 28, 2014, 3:30 PM - Sonia Maria: There are a bunch of things going on I haven't sorted anything out
Feb 28, 2014, 3:30 PM - Sonia Maria: And you?
Feb 28, 2014, 3:46 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Last time they also took a few days
Feb 28, 2014, 3:46 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Gonna have dinner with Matt
Feb 28, 2014, 3:46 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Then no plans, nothing heavy either
Feb 28, 2014, 4:00 PM - Sonia Maria: I'm going take this weekend to make time for people I've neglected in the past ~6 months
Feb 28, 2014, 4:01 PM - Sonia Maria: Feeling generous, or guilt. Or both
Feb 28, 2014, 4:01 PM - Sonia Maria: But yeah let's keep in touch
Feb 28, 2014, 4:21 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Ok cool
Feb 28, 2014, 4:21 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Lets talk
Feb 28, 2014, 6:15 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: My office right now
Feb 28, 2014, 6:15 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: <Media omitted>
Feb 28, 2014, 6:20 PM - Sonia Maria: ! What's happening
Feb 28, 2014, 6:27 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: All sorts of crazy shut
Feb 28, 2014, 7:33 PM - Sonia Maria: Haha yeah it seems it
Feb 28, 2014, 9:33 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Are you at the bazaar thing?
Feb 28, 2014, 10:02 PM - Sonia Maria: No
Feb 28, 2014, 10:03 PM - Sonia Maria: Decided to go to a friends birthday
Feb 28, 2014, 10:03 PM - Sonia Maria: Near mine
Feb 28, 2014, 10:12 PM - Sonia Maria: How's your night
Feb 28, 2014, 10:28 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Good, just out at bars in wburg
Feb 28, 2014, 10:28 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Nothing special
Feb 28, 2014, 11:06 PM - Sonia Maria: I'm at a dance party ish and extravagantly early. X
Mar 1, 2014, 12:06 AM - Sonia Maria: Are you still out / going to be out in the next hour
Mar 1, 2014, 12:12 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Im still in wburg
Mar 1, 2014, 12:12 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Whats your plan?
Mar 1, 2014, 12:21 AM - Sonia Maria: Want to leave within the next hour. Would be nice to meet you. Are you still in wburg?
Mar 1, 2014, 12:38 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Yes, come if you want!
Mar 1, 2014, 12:39 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I'm also gonna leave soon though
Mar 1, 2014, 12:39 AM - Sonia Maria: Leave to where? Home?
Mar 1, 2014, 12:40 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Maybe
Mar 1, 2014, 12:40 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Unless something is happening that is interesting
Mar 1, 2014, 12:42 AM - Sonia Maria: So I'm at a venue that's half shit and half decent. Half decent is where my friends are spinning
Mar 1, 2014, 12:43 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: What do you want to do?
Mar 1, 2014, 12:48 AM - Sonia Maria: I kind of want you to come here
Mar 1, 2014, 12:48 AM - Sonia Maria: And then we do our own thing
Mar 1, 2014, 12:49 AM - Sonia Maria: Either that or we just meet where you are
Mar 1, 2014, 12:54 AM - Sonia Maria: Having a smoke and leaving after.
Mar 1, 2014, 12:54 AM - Sonia Maria: Either home or to wherever you are, let me know
Mar 1, 2014, 12:56 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Come!
Mar 1, 2014, 12:57 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Come at videology
Mar 1, 2014, 12:57 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Bedford and s1st
Mar 1, 2014, 1:10 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Are you coming?
Mar 1, 2014, 1:11 AM - Sonia Maria: In taxi now
Mar 1, 2014, 1:12 AM - Sonia Maria: Uber obviously
Mar 1, 2014, 1:16 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Hahaha
Mar 1, 2014, 1:16 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Oh
Mar 1, 2014, 1:18 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: A really ugly guy in the subway was wearing an uber hat and he was with a cute girl and it was all ridiculous and absurd and I hated him and I really felt like slapping him him
Mar 1, 2014, 1:18 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: But I did not
Mar 1, 2014, 1:20 AM - Sonia Maria: Hahahha. That's awesome. You'll eventually realize that although you hate it, uber is a good thing
Mar 4, 2014, 2:56 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Good news, I'm as healthy as one can be :)
Mar 4, 2014, 2:56 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I'll reply to your email when I get some time later
Mar 4, 2014, 2:57 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Looks like I'm gonna have an opinion about it
Mar 4, 2014, 5:15 PM - Sonia Maria: Nice. Good news on my end as well, that time of month has come.
Mar 4, 2014, 5:15 PM - Sonia Maria: And yeah, check it out
Mar 4, 2014, 5:15 PM - Sonia Maria: Was just food for thought
Mar 4, 2014, 5:59 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: That's also great news
Mar 4, 2014, 5:59 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Are you up to something tomorrow night?
Mar 4, 2014, 6:20 PM - Sonia Maria: Yeah I've made plans to meet friends for drinks after work
Mar 4, 2014, 6:20 PM - Sonia Maria: Have you confirmed your travel dates ?
Mar 4, 2014, 6:21 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I'm leaving on Friday night until Wednesday
Mar 4, 2014, 6:21 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I want to see you before leaving
Mar 4, 2014, 6:50 PM - Sonia Maria: Thursday?
Mar 4, 2014, 7:42 PM - Sonia Maria: Unrelated, but my childhood friends who grew up in Carroll gardens referred to me as their "best friend from park slope who, for reasons still unknown, decided to move to Bushwick" I found that hilarious.
Mar 4, 2014, 7:42 PM - Sonia Maria: You might not get it, but then again you might
Mar 4, 2014, 8:40 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Thursday works
Mar 4, 2014, 8:42 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Also, quite difficult to disagree with your friends' point
Mar 4, 2014, 8:44 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: It may be related to your ghetto bourgois spirit :)
Mar 4, 2014, 9:45 PM - Sonia Maria: Hahaha. It may just be that
Mar 5, 2014, 1:19 AM - Sonia Maria: If you're still up
Mar 5, 2014, 1:20 AM - Sonia Maria: Let me know
Mar 5, 2014, 8:11 AM - Sonia Maria: Fucking hell. I sleep type. I don't remember texting or sending that email. That is lethal.
Mar 5, 2014, 9:33 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Hahahaha
Mar 5, 2014, 9:52 AM - Sonia Maria: We really need to talk about the app
Mar 5, 2014, 9:52 AM - Sonia Maria: It's a brilliant idea
Mar 5, 2014, 10:17 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Yes!
Mar 5, 2014, 10:18 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I have more ideas on how to make this happen
Mar 5, 2014, 10:18 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Let's talk when we meet
Mar 5, 2014, 10:20 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Also, winter is over and that makes me the happiest person
Mar 5, 2014, 11:15 AM - Sonia Maria: Excitement
Mar 5, 2014, 11:15 AM - Sonia Maria: And yeah it's warm out
Mar 5, 2014, 11:15 AM - Sonia Maria: Don't say it's over
Mar 5, 2014, 11:15 AM - Sonia Maria: It will start to shit snow on us if you do
Mar 5, 2014, 2:02 PM - Sonia Maria: Hey. I want to plan out these next 2 nights and see your schedule. Idk if you have plans for tonight. I'm going for catch up drinks but after there is a party at Louie and chan with Tim Sweeney. It's free entry. Would you want to go together for a bit? Because tomorrow, there is a group dinner again that I want to go to. Kind of fucks up my plan as I wanted to go to dinner w you but I would still like to see you. I guess after dinner? I'll be WFH Friday as well.
Mar 5, 2014, 2:02 PM - Sonia Maria: Thursday still works. Just wanted to see if you're keen on doing anything tonight
Mar 5, 2014, 3:20 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Hm
Mar 5, 2014, 3:20 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: What's the group dinner thing?
Mar 5, 2014, 3:21 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: And tonight, what time would you plan to go to the party?
Mar 5, 2014, 3:24 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I was planning to go to capoeira tonight but its in Bk, so going back to Mhn is not really an option. The alternative is to stay at work until then, cause I have enough to do before leaving, but it depends on how laye you're thinking
Mar 5, 2014, 3:24 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: *laye = late
Mar 5, 2014, 3:29 PM - Sonia Maria: The group dinner is the weekly female only dinner that seems to have evolved into a recurring thing
Mar 5, 2014, 3:29 PM - Sonia Maria: Hmmm
Mar 5, 2014, 3:29 PM - Sonia Maria: I would look to go around 10

Mar 5, 2014, 4:22 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I see. I think the best idea would be to go to the party tonight. I can pick you up wherever you are before 10 and go there for a bit? I have work to do and shit to buy for my nephew so making time will be easy :)

Mar 5, 2014, 7:37 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I want to see you but I don't want to interfere if you have your plans

Mar 18, 2014, 12:52 PM - Sonia Maria: Hi, just wanted to apologize for being so up and down with my mood last night and not really being attentive to anything going on at all. I really dislike when my mood swings start to affect my behavior w others.
Mar 18, 2014, 12:52 PM - Sonia Maria: Not sure if it was necessary, just felt the need to say that
Mar 18, 2014, 1:25 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Don't worry about it, I was not at my best yesterday

Mar 19, 2014, 1:56 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: What happened?
Mar 19, 2014, 1:56 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Are you still giving infinite thought to all your life?
Mar 19, 2014, 2:17 PM - Sonia Maria: No. True detective. It was just too heavy for right before sleep haha
Mar 19, 2014, 2:17 PM - Sonia Maria: Especially considering how much I over analyze just about everything
Mar 19, 2014, 2:21 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Haha
Mar 19, 2014, 2:21 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Late last night some dude was rapping his lungs out right under my window
Mar 19, 2014, 2:21 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: And some neighbor decided to throw him some eggs to make him shut up
Mar 19, 2014, 2:22 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Quite a scene
Mar 19, 2014, 2:27 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I loved TD

Mar 19, 2014, 2:31 PM - Sonia Maria: Hahaha. Wish I was there to witness that!
Mar 19, 2014, 2:33 PM - Sonia Maria: I told you, great show. The story flows like a film because the director is a filmmaker. It doesn't feel like a series and everything synchronizes so well
Mar 19, 2014, 2:34 PM - Sonia Maria: I was so captured by the last few episodes.
Mar 19, 2014, 2:34 PM - Sonia Maria: Filmmaker at heart **

Mar 19, 2014, 10:12 PM - Sonia Maria: My phone has shit service
Mar 19, 2014, 10:12 PM - Sonia Maria: I can't get directions to yours
Mar 19, 2014, 10:12 PM - Sonia Maria: I'm on metropolitan and Roebling
Mar 19, 2014, 10:13 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Tell them to take Kent Ave towards south
Mar 19, 2014, 10:13 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: It then becomes Franklin Ave
Mar 19, 2014, 10:13 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Once on Fulton make a left

Mar 19, 2014, 10:42 PM - Sonia Maria: #
Mar 19, 2014, 10:42 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: 6
Mar 20, 2014, 11:51 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: How are things?
Mar 20, 2014, 12:39 PM - Sonia Maria: It's alright. I just took the rest of the day off
Mar 20, 2014, 12:40 PM - Sonia Maria: I'm going to the hospital w my sister in about an hour. Thanks for being there for me last night
Mar 20, 2014, 12:44 PM - Sonia Maria: <3
Mar 20, 2014, 1:04 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I'm glad you felt comfortable enough with me. I hope it goes well at the hospital. Let me know.
Mar 20, 2014, 3:59 PM - Sonia Maria: I did feel comfortable. I just don't want to burden you. I did share a lot of personal detail regarding my father with you that maybe only 2 other people outside of my family. I've never been around someone when shit situations like this happen, I was really emotional and just ranting away.
Mar 20, 2014, 3:59 PM - Sonia Maria: Anyway, next time I see you I just want to be happy
Mar 20, 2014, 5:27 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: It does not burden me. The least I can do is be there for you when something this hard is happening in your life. It's not fair to have to go through this alone. You have the right to be emotional and rant away.
Mar 20, 2014, 7:04 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Is everything alright?
Mar 20, 2014, 7:36 PM - Sonia Maria: Everything's ok. I saw my father. He looks terrible. I just went on a really long walk. Which helped. I'm going to meet all the zero girls in a bit, hopefully I will feel better with good company around me. Otherwise I'll just leave
Mar 20, 2014, 7:37 PM - Sonia Maria: I hope you had some time to enjoy the day, the weather was pretty amazing
Mar 20, 2014, 7:43 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I'm really sorry you're going through all this. Being with the zeroettes should help get distracted. Otherwise, let me know if you need somebody to talk or just hug.
Mar 20, 2014, 8:37 PM - Sonia Maria: :) I appreciate that
Mar 20, 2014, 8:44 PM - Sonia Maria: You had plans tonight you had mentioned, right?
Mar 20, 2014, 9:08 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I'm having drinks w my coworkers cause one of them is leaving
Mar 20, 2014, 9:08 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Not for long though
Mar 20, 2014, 9:08 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: How's the dinner?
Mar 20, 2014, 9:49 PM - Sonia Maria: A lot of the girls cancelled last minute so it's quite intimate
Mar 20, 2014, 9:49 PM - Sonia Maria: Still waiting on the food though
Mar 20, 2014, 9:50 PM - Sonia Maria: But definitely serving as a good distraction
Mar 20, 2014, 10:56 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Who's house is it at?

Mar 20, 2014, 11:13 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I was going to sleep soon, but I can wait for you
Mar 20, 2014, 11:14 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: When are you thinking?
Mar 20, 2014, 11:22 PM - Sonia Maria: I wanted to leave after tasting dessert, which is coming now. I kind of want to be with you, but if you're tired and want to sleep, go ahead. I could be there in about 30min.
Mar 20, 2014, 11:22 PM - Sonia Maria: Or less
Mar 20, 2014, 11:23 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I'll wait for you.
Mar 20, 2014, 11:23 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Lmk when you're in the cab

Apr 11, 2014, 9:37 PM - Sonia Maria: Well, I'm with my old roommate Hannah now. She actually lives in bedstuy. I was thinking to maybe meet you where you are. However being that I haven't seen her in ages and her life is somewhat in shambles, unsure how social her and I would be rather than just catching up on our own
Apr 11, 2014, 9:41 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Im at washington commons , with a couple friends. If you guys want to come here and do your thing thats fine
Apr 11, 2014, 9:41 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: We'll be here for a bit

Apr 12, 2014, 4:12 PM - Sonia Maria: I've actually been sitting on this bench over analyzing pieces of our conversation. Not that I'm focusing on bad things but, you know, just thinking. And then I receive this message so that was lovely
Apr 12, 2014, 4:17 PM - Sonia Maria: I also realize I may have too much free time on my hands that can be utilized for much more productive things haha
Apr 12, 2014, 4:27 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I can have you critique my cover letters, if you want to do something productive ;)
Apr 12, 2014, 4:32 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I'd still like to know what your thinking ends up in. Don't think too much though, the main take away for all this is that it is absolutely awesome that this is happening :)))
Apr 12, 2014, 4:39 PM - Sonia Maria: Yeah, send it over to me!
Apr 12, 2014, 4:40 PM - Sonia Maria: And we can discuss later, and that's why I am not trying to focus on bad things cause what's happening is wonderful

Apr 17, 2014, 1:40 PM - Sonia Maria: Ok, well I am flexible with what weekend I travel outside of LDN. I would rather work around dates that are most convenient for you.
Apr 17, 2014, 1:43 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Doesnt it also depend on Olivia?
Apr 17, 2014, 1:44 PM - Sonia Maria: I am able to stay the whole trip at her flat
Apr 17, 2014, 1:45 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: But I mean about the weekend you're leaving
Apr 17, 2014, 1:52 PM - Sonia Maria: Hmm, the weekend I travel doesn't depend on Olivia as I'm welcome to stay at hers both weekends. She may even also join me, so...
Apr 17, 2014, 1:54 PM - Sonia Maria: Or I'm not fully understanding your question >.<
Apr 17, 2014, 1:54 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Haha
Apr 17, 2014, 1:55 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: No I mean, if she is joining you, as I imagined she would, it also depends on her availability to do so
Apr 17, 2014, 1:56 PM - Sonia Maria: She isn't working and she only has uni. She said, and I quote, "I have all the time in the world"
Apr 17, 2014, 3:24 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Ok cool

Apr 17, 2014, 4:34 PM - Sonia Maria: Oh no, did something happen?
Apr 17, 2014, 4:37 PM - Sonia Maria: It's easy for those feelings to build in this situation, it's something you have to withstand for now
Apr 17, 2014, 4:57 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I guess you're right
Apr 17, 2014, 4:57 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I'm just getting very bored

Apr 21, 2014, 10:10 PM - Sonia Maria: Hey I'm actually realizing I'm still not in the best mood and I don't want to be all sad around you. I'm also pretty busy this week and since I'm leaving this weekend I wanted to find some time to see you. But it's fine, we'll meet later in the week. Sleep well

Apr 21, 2014, 10:44 PM - Sonia Maria: I am just not the type of person to spread sadness so it's better for me to be alone right now. I'm kind of worried about how low I actually feel. But it's fine, we'll speak tomorrow.
Apr 21, 2014, 11:09 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: You leave me a little worried, but I understand if you want to be alone. Let's speak tomorrow. Don't think too much: you're amazing. :***

Apr 24, 2014, 8:32 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: So it was actually in the living room, on the way from the bathroom. I asked Julien if it was his and he says no, so I assumed it was yours :D
Apr 24, 2014, 9:35 AM - Sonia Maria: 🙈
Apr 24, 2014, 9:51 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: 😅
Apr 24, 2014, 11:18 AM - Sonia Maria: I also think everyone in your apartment is tired of seeing me there all the time >_>, so that doesn't really help at all
Apr 24, 2014, 12:00 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: That's totally false.
Apr 24, 2014, 12:10 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I mean, you kidding? Diana has people over ALL the time. It's totally fine

Apr 25, 2014, 11:22 AM - Sonia Maria: How did it go?
Apr 25, 2014, 11:22 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I guess they couldn't resist the temptation of behaving like a real midtown club
Apr 25, 2014, 11:23 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I mean, shittt

Apr 30, 2014, 11:28 AM - Sonia Maria: What are the options? I'm out of the loop :/
Apr 30, 2014, 11:28 AM - Sonia Maria: I know Knewton
Apr 30, 2014, 11:29 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Yeah, well, both are within Kneeton
Apr 30, 2014, 11:29 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Knewton
Apr 30, 2014, 11:29 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: One as frontend
Apr 30, 2014, 11:30 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: The other in a new thing called data arts lab
Apr 30, 2014, 11:30 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Closer to marketing
Apr 30, 2014, 11:31 AM - Sonia Maria: Oh right then it am aware. I remember you saying you didn't want to be in marketing though.
Apr 30, 2014, 11:31 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I know
Apr 30, 2014, 11:31 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: But after talking w the lead it does look cool
Apr 30, 2014, 11:31 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Oh man, I dont know
Apr 30, 2014, 11:35 AM - Sonia Maria: Hmmm, what factors are causing your indecisiveness?
Apr 30, 2014, 11:41 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Future employability, colleagues, level of techincal challenge, visibility
Apr 30, 2014, 11:41 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I don't want to distract you
Apr 30, 2014, 11:41 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I'll figure it out

Apr 30, 2014, 12:05 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I need to know today, yeah
Apr 30, 2014, 12:07 PM - Sonia Maria: I said it wrong. I just meant to say it's not a distraction to me, that I'm here to listen if it helps you better evaluate and make a decision
Apr 30, 2014, 12:21 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: :D Thanks
Apr 30, 2014, 12:22 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I think Im leaning towards the Data Arts thing
Apr 30, 2014, 12:22 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Its riskier, and I have a hard time accepting it, but it makes more sense I think
Apr 30, 2014, 12:25 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Im sending you an article, unrelated
Apr 30, 2014, 1:08 PM - Sonia Maria: What would be your position exactly?

Apr 30, 2014, 1:37 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I enjoyed that more
Apr 30, 2014, 1:37 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: But I'm a bit unsure about the future
Apr 30, 2014, 1:38 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: It will leave a lot of room to explore new technologies
Apr 30, 2014, 4:24 PM - Sonia Maria: I'd like to hear l
Apr 30, 2014, 4:24 PM - Sonia Maria: *I'd like to hear more about it

May 2, 2014, 11:01 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: See youuu
May 2, 2014, 11:01 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: :*
May 5, 2014, 10:59 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I dont know what the hell happened last night but I still feel restless and a bit anxious
May 5, 2014, 11:04 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Sorry I was in a bad mood this morning
May 5, 2014, 11:15 AM - Sonia Maria: I don't know either. To be honest, I think a part of it is the amount of time we spend together. It didn't seem to sit well with you these past days. I really think you just need time apart to re evaluate things. You seem to be very dissatisfied and in doubt and I wish I could help, but I can't.
May 5, 2014, 11:18 AM - Sonia Maria: I'm also leaving for London so it works. You'll probably realize what the root of this problem is.
May 5, 2014, 11:19 AM - Sonia Maria: This morning I left and I never expected to feel bitter and sad, but I did. So I realized the best solution is probably time apart.
May 5, 2014, 11:21 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Things are mixing in the wrong way.
May 5, 2014, 11:22 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: The uncertainty of ny job situation has added to the stress and I've made you go through it
May 5, 2014, 11:23 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: At the same time, wanting to spend a lot of time with you has made me do things I should have known were not gonna make me happy
May 5, 2014, 11:24 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Like going out on saturday, and then I feel bad for not focusing on work and it all merges in the worng way
May 5, 2014, 11:25 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Maybe you're right and taking it a bit easier on the time we spend together will help get perspective
May 5, 2014, 11:26 AM - Sonia Maria: To be honest I had told you numerous times you should not have not have come if you did not want to
May 5, 2014, 11:26 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I know I know
May 5, 2014, 11:26 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I'm the only one to blame here
May 5, 2014, 11:27 AM - Sonia Maria: And yes, you will probably realize that maybe I'm not the right person for you. And that's fine. I really just don't want to get hurt and I feel like this could easily head into that
May 5, 2014, 11:27 AM - Sonia Maria: So I'm pulling away
May 5, 2014, 11:27 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: But I just feel a lot of stuff happening around me and I don't feel well equipped to make decisions
May 5, 2014, 11:27 AM - Sonia Maria: I don't know what to tell you
May 5, 2014, 11:28 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Maybe, but there are so many things about you I feel incredibly lucky to be in touch with
May 5, 2014, 11:29 AM - Sonia Maria: That's really not reason enough in my mind to be with someone
May 5, 2014, 11:30 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I don't want this to end, I like you and want more of you
May 5, 2014, 11:30 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I know I'm not easy
May 5, 2014, 11:32 AM - Sonia Maria: No you're not. But I felt that the amount of time we spent together added on to your issues
May 5, 2014, 11:32 AM - Sonia Maria: We can just take a break and then I leave for two weeks, you have time to sort things out
May 5, 2014, 11:33 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I'm sorry you feel so hurt, I didnt realize how much this was affecting the way you're seeing us
May 5, 2014, 11:34 AM - Sonia Maria: You were unhappy all weekend and I was with you all weekend
May 5, 2014, 11:35 AM - Sonia Maria: Looking at these past few days as a whole, you and I are actually a part of the problem.
May 5, 2014, 11:35 AM - Sonia Maria: To be honest it hurts to talk about this because I thought we were ok. But after this weekend I'm pretty hurt.
May 5, 2014, 11:37 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I thought we were too! I honestly think it's my insecurity at work that has spread into us, because last week was the most difficult for me in that sense
May 5, 2014, 11:41 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I mean, you can understand that there have been some difficult decisions in my life, and it's nit easy to try to balance it and not have it affect anything else, especially when we're trying to create something meaningful and beautiful, but also new and not without challenges
May 5, 2014, 11:46 AM - Sonia Maria: I completely understand this. But my thing is, I just felt like a detriment to you. And I definitely do not want to do that
May 5, 2014, 11:46 AM - Sonia Maria: I also realize I had no way to help you either
May 5, 2014, 11:48 AM - Sonia Maria: So I guess I am also starting to feel lost. Is this right for both of us? We should figure that out before moving forward.
May 5, 2014, 11:48 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I think you believe you can't help me, but I think you can
May 5, 2014, 11:48 AM - Sonia Maria: Because I really do not want to continue feeling sad and low.
May 5, 2014, 11:48 AM - Sonia Maria: Also, I just want to note that this is a really heavy conversation to be having right now
May 5, 2014, 11:49 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: You're right
May 5, 2014, 11:50 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Let's try to talk later then, not on whatsapp
May 5, 2014, 11:54 AM - Sonia Maria: I'm going to need a few days to clear my thoughts. I'm feeling really emotional and I want to have some rational thought put into this.
May 5, 2014, 11:59 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I understand, I probably need that as well.
May 9, 2014, 4:42 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Are we on for 6 then?
May 9, 2014, 4:57 PM - Sonia Maria: Yep
May 9, 2014, 4:58 PM - Sonia Maria: I'll let you know when I head
May 9, 2014, 5:37 PM - Sonia Maria: On my way

May 9, 2014, 6:08 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Where?

May 9, 2014, 6:08 PM - Sonia Maria: Yeah I just realized I got of don the wrong floor, wasn't paying attention

It's funny, I am having a fun time and catching up with great people and feeling the beauty of the London air. However, I find myself wanting you here and experiencing all of this with me. I still feel so connected to you even though we are currently so far apart. It makes me smile. Anyway, enough of my rant. I'm just so happy we are growing and getting to know each other and I can't wait for more and more of this :)

May 19, 2014, 4:46 PM - Sonia Maria: I've just been short tempered, getting irritated. Olivia has been quite off w me as well. I'm not going to look too much into it right now.
May 19, 2014, 5:06 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Did you decide where you're moving yet?
May 19, 2014, 5:25 PM - Sonia Maria: Yes, I'm in whitechapel. Which is perfect in terms of location. So I'll probably be here till weekend
May 19, 2014, 5:54 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Thats cool, not having to commute much is happiness. Dont overthink things if you can :** Lets talk in the morning if you can.

May 21, 2014, 11:36 AM - Sonia Maria: I will speak to my mother bc she is able to get me into Iberia flights at lower cost.
May 21, 2014, 11:37 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: There are only 4 weekdays in there
May 21, 2014, 11:37 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Cool, check w your mom, itd be great if you came :)))

May 21, 2014, 3:45 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Last day I decided to stay in Madrid at night because the flight to the US was too early from Madrid
May 21, 2014, 3:45 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Cooool

May 22, 2014, 9:21 AM - Sonia Maria: Anyway, I completely disregarded your first email yesterday, but I hope today is less bad than yesterday! :***
May 22, 2014, 9:24 AM - Sonia Maria: I am also 100% doing a detox when I return to NY, mainly because at that point my body will only be generating pure hate for itself
May 22, 2014, 11:21 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Today is much better thanks. The 40mile bike ride around Brooklyn was uplifting.
May 22, 2014, 11:21 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Cool, I can keep doing my detox until secret mountain with you
May 22, 2014, 11:37 AM - Sonia Maria: That's good to hear
May 22, 2014, 11:38 AM - Sonia Maria: I spoke to my mother just now actually. She needs to set up a meeting w Iberia people to see if her discount crosses over to that airline. Being that Iberia and BA merged, I should have no issue. In this case, I will go
May 22, 2014, 11:38 AM - Sonia Maria: Because I will pay more than half price of a reg ticket.
May 22, 2014, 11:39 AM - Sonia Maria: Tbh the dates are fine, it's more a money issue for me now as I want to continue saving for this year. So I'll keep you posted.
May 22, 2014, 12:53 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I understand, it is a really expensive time to fly there
May 22, 2014, 12:53 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I just need to see them anyways
May 22, 2014, 12:53 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: But let me know if therr are updates
May 22, 2014, 1:17 PM - Sonia Maria: Ok
May 22, 2014, 1:17 PM - Sonia Maria: Will do
May 22, 2014, 3:03 PM - Sonia Maria: Vanessa messaged me and asked me if you are interested in joining the party bus for secret mountain
May 22, 2014, 3:04 PM - Sonia Maria: Crowd Tilt the Bus http://tilt.tc/pY23
May 22, 2014, 3:04 PM - Sonia Maria: 100 round trip.
May 22, 2014, 3:06 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Hm
May 22, 2014, 3:07 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I honestly dont think so
May 22, 2014, 3:07 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Thats too much
May 22, 2014, 3:07 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Thats up to 230 for 1 party of one night.

May 22, 2014, 3:20 PM - Sonia Maria: Yes, you're right. 250, actually
May 22, 2014, 3:20 PM - Sonia Maria: I will take some time to think.
May 22, 2014, 3:21 PM - Sonia Maria: However, transport will be an issue
May 22, 2014, 3:36 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Is there any way to get there by reg bus?
May 22, 2014, 3:37 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: The other option is to get a rental car. But that's only if we can stay Sunday and go back on Monday superearly, because I'd rather not drive on Sunday
May 22, 2014, 4:08 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Rental w Ana, Julien, Raisa or whoever
May 22, 2014, 4:18 PM - Sonia Maria: Will this be cheaper than the party bus? Let's look into it
May 22, 2014, 4:18 PM - Sonia Maria: I will ask Raisa
May 22, 2014, 4:18 PM - Sonia Maria: But I'm pretty sure she booked the bus already
May 22, 2014, 4:38 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: If we get 5 or so of us, it could be around 40. Would you fine staying until Mday early morning? I mean, I dont know, we'll figure it out
May 22, 2014, 4:38 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Itll be fine
May 22, 2014, 4:39 PM - Sonia Maria: Yes. Workwise, I can just work second half of day

May 23, 2014, 3:30 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Not really. But I suspect some things that would work to fix it. Just not available for now (getting away, for ex)
May 23, 2014, 6:46 PM - Sonia Maria: I received your email.
For some reason my anxiety has not gone away. 
And I abruptly just cancelled my plans for tonight. I think I will just chill and have a prop night's sleep
May 23, 2014, 6:47 PM - Sonia Maria: I kind of want us to be together right now...
May 23, 2014, 7:39 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: We need to be hugging together in Menorca and let all this go away
May 23, 2014, 7:42 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Meep

May 26, 2014, 1:16 PM - Sonia Maria: It's like prop London weather today. Grey and drizzly.

May 27, 2014, 8:14 AM - Sonia Maria: Yes! Both sad and happy about this
May 27, 2014, 9:32 AM - Sonia Maria: It's another gloomy day here. I'm heading to saatchi gallery. Kind of reminds me of the day we went to dia:beacon

May 27, 2014, 12:30 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Any updates about Menorca?
May 27, 2014, 12:52 PM - Sonia Maria: My mother said the people she knows in Iberia haven't gotten back to her. But she said I will most likely have to go thru LHR. This doesn't really bother me, it's more the price.
May 27, 2014, 12:52 PM - Sonia Maria: I think by the end of this week I will have a more definite answer
May 27, 2014, 12:55 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I can help with the price a bit, if it gets crazy
May 27, 2014, 12:56 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Also, you may want to fly to Minorca straight from LHR, there are a lot of flights from there
May 27, 2014, 1:44 PM - Sonia Maria: Ok, that would make sense
May 27, 2014, 1:49 PM - Sonia Maria: So before I meet you tomorrow I will begin looking for flights online (under the assumption that this discount applies).
May 27, 2014, 1:51 PM - Sonia Maria: Btw, at saatchi the current exhibition was for new African and Latin American art.
May 27, 2014, 1:51 PM - Sonia Maria: You would have enjoyed it
May 27, 2014, 1:51 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: It sounds like I would have
May 27, 2014, 1:52 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: That sounds. Fingers crossed you'll find sth affordable
May 27, 2014, 1:52 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: That sounds good, I meant
May 27, 2014, 2:01 PM - Sonia Maria: :)
May 27, 2014, 2:02 PM - Sonia Maria: Also, is there any news on BM?

May 27, 2014, 7:43 PM - Sonia Maria: Haha so Olivia organized a surprise farewell dinner for me which was lovely. It was at a Caribbean place that I told her I've been wanting to try. However, she is not used to spicy food (... Jerk chicken is not exactly spicy). But anyway, it seems it has gotten her a bit sick
May 27, 2014, 7:43 PM - Sonia Maria: I feel terrible, but her German roots are to blame haha
May 28, 2014, 1:06 PM - Sonia Maria: I'm back
May 28, 2014, 1:21 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Yoohooooo

I will discuss with you when we meet later. To be honest I'm dependent on my mother about this, which generally annoys me. But I am seeing her tomo during the day so I can get this done

Jun 1, 2014, 12:12 AM - Sonia Maria: So I can meet you wherever you are

Jun 1, 2014, 2:21 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Almost home
Jun 1, 2014, 2:22 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Youcan come now
Jun 1, 2014, 1:46 PM - Sonia Maria: I forgot to tell you I found this in my dad's old library and starting to read it. Should be interesting
Jun 1, 2014, 1:46 PM - Sonia Maria: <Media omitted>
Jun 1, 2014, 2:17 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Interesting. Let me know what its like.
Jun 1, 2014, 2:19 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Btw, Im thinking Im going to try and work until 530 or a bit more. We could try to go sunday around 6-630 if you want, or leave for another day. How is it looking for you?
Jun 1, 2014, 2:36 PM - Sonia Maria: Will do. So I'm with Alea now and were going to some thing happening at Bushwick Collective. She seems keen on mister Sunday. And it's beautiful out. I think we will go. If so, will be around 4-5
Jun 1, 2014, 2:36 PM - Sonia Maria: But also not entirely sure
Jun 1, 2014, 2:37 PM - Sonia Maria: I want you to be there too. Just let me know whatever you decide. I'll be around :)
Jun 1, 2014, 2:46 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Ok cool. So you're definitely not going to Marie's? If you guys are going to Sunday I'll probably join you there later. :))
Jun 1, 2014, 3:10 PM - Sonia Maria: As of now, no. I'm also being super indecisive. But I have a lot of my friends who I haven't seen in a while coming over to my area. And I want to see what they have in mind. Deep down, I just want to dance and enjoy the sun (as you can see, still in that great mood). I will keep you posted in any case.
Jun 1, 2014, 3:10 PM - Sonia Maria: Also, just to make you laugh
Jun 1, 2014, 3:11 PM - Sonia Maria: <Media omitted>
Jun 1, 2014, 3:11 PM - Sonia Maria: Wait, it's not a GIF.
Jun 1, 2014, 3:12 PM - Sonia Maria: Never mind :/
Jun 1, 2014, 3:12 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Haha its pretty funny anywaya
Jun 1, 2014, 3:12 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Yeah, I still want to use some sun!! Its so pretty
Jun 1, 2014, 3:13 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I can see your great mood :)))
Jun 1, 2014, 4:00 PM - Sonia Maria: It is so nice out. I'm still in Bushwick, and still waiting for friends. So I don't know about mister Sunday at this point. There's a block party here, so I'm still having fun
Jun 1, 2014, 4:04 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Im sure its not comparable to Sunday ;)
Jun 1, 2014, 4:18 PM - Sonia Maria: No, definitely not
Jun 1, 2014, 4:22 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I would still try to go later, lile 630 or so. What do you think?
Jun 1, 2014, 4:22 PM - Sonia Maria: But I want to go ;_;
Jun 1, 2014, 4:22 PM - Sonia Maria: It's quite a large group and it's annoying to make a collective decision
Jun 1, 2014, 4:25 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Meep, ok, let me know.
Jun 1, 2014, 4:26 PM - Sonia Maria: I will join you. 7pmish? And I'll see if Alea will also want to join
Jun 1, 2014, 4:27 PM - Sonia Maria: :/
Jun 1, 2014, 4:30 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Dont worry, do your thing. We'll see if it makes sense later. Im going out now around the park.
Jun 1, 2014, 5:18 PM - Sonia Maria: Yep, go with the flow. We've got everyone to agree to come to our rooftop.
Jun 1, 2014, 5:18 PM - Sonia Maria: Enjoy the sun :)

Jun 4, 2014, 10:45 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Sure, but let me know if it looks like its gonna get too late
Jun 4, 2014, 11:04 PM - Sonia Maria: I don't know what's happening w Alea, but she seems to be having a really bad come down. She's been going out a lot. And she has no plans. We are back at our apartment. I want to see you, but I also don't think I can leave her alone. She seems super anxious...
Jun 5, 2014, 5:47 PM - Sonia Maria: Hey. I'm going to be in Bushwick tonight, at Jamie's. There's a little get together. I assume you want to take it easy as you want to be prepared for tomo. But if you want to stop by on your way home we can go for a walk or something. Just wanted to spend some time with you. If you have plans / don't want to, I understand.
Jun 5, 2014, 5:59 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Heya. We could do that, but Im not biking today. Where are you going to be? Im gonna get a beer w a friend after work, maybe after that itll be too late?
Jun 5, 2014, 6:00 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Are you already in bushwick?
Jun 5, 2014, 6:01 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: We should be able to figure it out

Jun 8, 2014, 6:48 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Yess, we should do that a lot. At least repeat a weekend like the one we did, but at the beach!
Jun 9, 2014, 1:42 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Heya
Jun 9, 2014, 5:57 PM - Sonia Maria: Hey. I just woke up from a nap. I didn't mean to worry you, though I understand completely why you did. I have to get some work done and then I can definitely come meet you, around 8 or so? I assume you will be already having dinner by this time, but I still want to meet your mother. So let me know, and I can meet you.
Jun 9, 2014, 5:58 PM - Sonia Maria: Also, I'm kind of angry at myself for not being 100% as I feel a bit crappy. But, whatever. :/
Jun 9, 2014, 6:04 PM - Sonia Maria: Also also, reaaaallly missing you.
Jun 9, 2014, 6:37 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Ok cool! :) Let me know when you're ready and I'll tell you where we're at
Jun 9, 2014, 6:48 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: We're going to williamsburg actually
Jun 9, 2014, 7:01 PM - Sonia Maria: Ok perfect.
Jun 9, 2014, 7:01 PM - Sonia Maria: Will message you in a bit when I'm finishing up
Jun 9, 2014, 7:52 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: We're at a random backyard called Northern Bell
Jun 9, 2014, 8:02 PM - Sonia Maria: Just finished. Off the Lorimer stop, right?
Jun 9, 2014, 8:03 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Yup!
Jun 9, 2014, 8:11 PM - Sonia Maria: On my way now
Jun 9, 2014, 9:20 PM - Sonia Maria: So your mother's super lovely. I was so shit conversation, but anyway I still wanted to meet her. I hope in future opportunities, it will be a lot smoother for me haha. Just need another full night's sleep.
Jun 9, 2014, 9:25 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: It was great! :) Thank you so much for coming out, she's loved you! Get better. I'll see you tomorrow babe :***
Jun 9, 2014, 9:27 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Oh, and let me know what Laurent says about Matt & Nuria please
Jun 9, 2014, 9:46 PM - Sonia Maria: Ok great. I'm so happy I met her!! I will :) see you tomorrow :***
Jun 9, 2014, 9:49 PM - Sonia Maria: Also, I've messaged Laurent
Jun 9, 2014, 9:49 PM - Sonia Maria: So I'm waiting for his response. I said we can all pay up front too
Jun 9, 2014, 9:50 PM - Sonia Maria: Also, what did Matt say he would do? Book a van?
Jun 9, 2014, 9:50 PM - Sonia Maria: If this doesn't work out
Jun 9, 2014, 9:56 PM - Sonia Maria: Also, both you and I have a bed for SMP. Maybe we should give one to someone else?
Jun 9, 2014, 10:01 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: He was thinking of renting a car, but itll be expensive if they dont get enough people
Jun 9, 2014, 10:01 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Bed? We have a bed? Yay
Jun 9, 2014, 10:10 PM - Sonia Maria: Right. That's the thing, we paid early so we both have 2 beds. I was thinking we could give it to someone else. Vanessa posted it on FB.
Jun 9, 2014, 10:10 PM - Sonia Maria: Or we can have 2 beds haha.
Jun 9, 2014, 10:10 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Fuck everybody
Jun 9, 2014, 10:10 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: The can sleep on the rocks outside
Jun 9, 2014, 10:10 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Haha
Jun 9, 2014, 10:11 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: No, sure, lets give it to somebody
Jun 9, 2014, 10:12 PM - Sonia Maria: Hahaha
Jun 10, 2014, 12:13 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Matt got a budget car, so Nuria and him dont need the van
Jun 10, 2014, 12:13 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I dont know about Ana
Jun 10, 2014, 1:40 PM - Sonia Maria: Ok. I've messaged Laurent.
Do matt and Nuria have room or is that car just for them?
Jun 10, 2014, 1:40 PM - Sonia Maria: Also, am I still seeing you later?
Jun 10, 2014, 2:06 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: They have room I think
Jun 10, 2014, 2:06 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Also, yes
Jun 10, 2014, 4:41 PM - Sonia Maria: When / where do you want to meet? I'll be finishing up at work in about 30min
Jun 10, 2014, 4:58 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I wont be out until 7, so whatever works for you. You could come here or we could meet in Brooklyn
Jun 10, 2014, 5:30 PM - Sonia Maria: It will be easier to meet in Brooklyn
Jun 10, 2014, 5:31 PM - Sonia Maria: Let me know when you get to Bedstuy
Jun 10, 2014, 5:51 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Shit. There is a class in information design I wanted to try out at SVA. Its at 630 so it may be a bit later when I get to bedstuy
Jun 10, 2014, 5:57 PM - Sonia Maria: Ok. How long is the class? I guess it's fine as long as you're not out super late.
Jun 10, 2014, 5:59 PM - Sonia Maria: Also, Laurent hasn't gotten back to me and I don't want to deal w transport issues last minute. So options are to get a car of our own or I will just tag along with friends who have already sorted out transport plans.
Jun 10, 2014, 6:07 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I think its two hours, but I may leave early if I dont like it
Jun 10, 2014, 6:08 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Oh that sucks bad. Matt and Nuria have a car, but we're not going to fit there all of us
Jun 10, 2014, 6:21 PM - Sonia Maria: How many people can they fit? I am finally in contact w Oli, who took over the van booking, and if we can split the group of 4 into 2 then this can also work.
Jun 10, 2014, 6:27 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: We should be able to
Jun 10, 2014, 6:35 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Im not going to the class, I'll be home in 30min and we can figure it all out
Jun 10, 2014, 6:54 PM - Sonia Maria: Ok. Let me know when you arrive
Jun 10, 2014, 7:05 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Here
Jun 10, 2014, 7:09 PM - Sonia Maria: On my way
Jun 10, 2014, 7:09 PM - Sonia Maria: Be there in 20 or so
Jun 10, 2014, 7:11 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: A'ight
Jun 11, 2014, 6:48 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: A'ight
Jun 11, 2014, 1:32 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Hows the day going?
Jun 11, 2014, 2:21 PM - Sonia Maria: It's a bit busy. I'm getting a lot of work done though. And yours?
Jun 11, 2014, 2:22 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Kind of the same, nice day. What time you estimate youll be out?
Jun 11, 2014, 2:32 PM - Sonia Maria: I think around 7. I may continue working at home as well, hopefully not but I have a deadline for tomorrow.
Jun 11, 2014, 2:35 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Oh shit, that much work. Ok, let me know if you can meet up later.
Jun 11, 2014, 2:40 PM - Sonia Maria: It's bc I have been slacking since Monday. It's worst case anyway, I'll let you know.
Jun 11, 2014, 7:16 PM - Sonia Maria: I can meet you around 9. Does this also work for you?
Jun 11, 2014, 7:21 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Yeah. Want to come over or meet somewhere?
Jun 11, 2014, 7:38 PM - Sonia Maria: I'm going home in about 10min to change and stuff. So we can meet at yours and decide to go elsewhere unless you don't think you'll be home
Jun 11, 2014, 7:39 PM - Sonia Maria: Then I can meet you wherever
Jun 11, 2014, 7:52 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I will, I literally just got home
Jun 11, 2014, 8:19 PM - Sonia Maria: I just got to mine, I'll let you know when Im on my way
Jun 11, 2014, 8:40 PM - Sonia Maria: I'm heading over
Jun 11, 2014, 8:40 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Cool
Jun 12, 2014, 11:25 AM - Sonia Maria: I've decided I'm still going. If things are weird between us, well there's a bunch of people going so we don't necessarily need to be in each other's faces the whole time. I want to enjoy being away and the weather and it will give me time to think. Caroline reached out to me, if you're interested in getting anything, you'll have to let me know by tonight.
Jun 12, 2014, 11:28 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: This makes me immensely happy. Thanks. Thank you for a lot of things.
Jun 12, 2014, 12:27 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I think it'll be good for both of us, and as you say, we can be together but not be on each other all the time
Jun 12, 2014, 12:27 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Happy :)
Jun 12, 2014, 1:03 PM - Sonia Maria: Yep, exactly that
Jun 12, 2014, 2:10 PM - Sonia Maria: Btw, can you find out from Ana and co. if they want any M? Caroline is putting the order tonight. I'm securing mine so I don't have to worry.   $120/g
Jun 12, 2014, 2:12 PM - Sonia Maria: We will also have to sort out payment if it turns into a large order...
Jun 12, 2014, 2:41 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I think we'll do 1g for us
Jun 12, 2014, 3:27 PM - Sonia Maria: Cool
Jun 12, 2014, 5:15 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Let me know if you need it upfront
Jun 12, 2014, 5:54 PM - Sonia Maria: By tomo eve, if possible.
Jun 12, 2014, 6:00 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Of course, whenever
Jun 12, 2014, 7:04 PM - Sonia Maria: Ok, thanks
Jun 12, 2014, 9:03 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: How has your day been?
Jun 12, 2014, 9:11 PM - Sonia Maria: I feel a whole lot better than I did this morning, so that says something.
Jun 12, 2014, 9:12 PM - Sonia Maria: How have you been?
Jun 12, 2014, 9:12 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Ive been good, really busy today.
Jun 12, 2014, 9:13 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I felt strange in the morning
Jun 12, 2014, 9:13 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: But Im feeling better now as well
Jun 12, 2014, 9:15 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Just getting home after a long walk w my friend
Jun 12, 2014, 9:17 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Really loolong forward to being away this weekend
Jun 12, 2014, 9:17 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: *looking
Jun 12, 2014, 9:23 PM - Sonia Maria: Same, I'm glad to hear you feel better
Jun 12, 2014, 9:25 PM - Sonia Maria: I hope your concerns about us have subsided. If not, then I hope you'll be honest with me when we're together again.
Jun 12, 2014, 9:41 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: They've subsidized. I think I haven't been fair with you and with myself, and projecting things. I want to be happy with you.
Jun 12, 2014, 9:43 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Something has felt off in me for a while, and I need some things in my life to change, in order to be able to appreciate and feel open.
Jun 12, 2014, 9:43 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I realize, for example, that I havent left the city since you and I were away for the weekend. That's totally unacceptable.
Jun 12, 2014, 9:44 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I want to feel creative and inspired like I can be
Jun 12, 2014, 9:46 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: So that I can fully appreciate how lucky I am to be with you
Jun 12, 2014, 9:52 PM - Sonia Maria: I totally understand this. It's also not one sided in terms of making us the best we can be. I was not helping when you speak of things that inspire and interest you and dismiss them quite coldly. This city is so easily capable of making one feel entrapped and almost begin to spiral down. You're obviously aware of this. This weekend will be good. And you will travel again to Barcelona and Menorca. It will be a breath of fresh air.
Jun 12, 2014, 9:56 PM - Sonia Maria: I also want us to be happy
Jun 12, 2014, 9:56 PM - Sonia Maria: Thank you for these messages
Jun 12, 2014, 9:57 PM - Sonia Maria: I'm feeling even better now...
Jun 12, 2014, 10:01 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I know, Im really excited about leaving.
Jun 12, 2014, 10:02 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Thanks babe :)
Jun 12, 2014, 10:13 PM - Sonia Maria: :)
Jun 12, 2014, 10:13 PM - Sonia Maria: We're both lucky
Jun 12, 2014, 10:13 PM - Sonia Maria: Also. This weekend! Woooooohoooo
Jun 12, 2014, 10:21 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: :)))
Jun 12, 2014, 10:42 PM - Sonia Maria: Look! Alea's new tattoo is basically yours but not colored in and on her wrist
Jun 12, 2014, 10:42 PM - Sonia Maria: <Media omitted>
Jun 12, 2014, 10:42 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Haha, niceee
Jun 13, 2014, 2:53 PM - Sonia Maria: Departure is still 8am in Williamsburg

Jun 13, 2014, 3:05 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I have to give you the money
Jun 13, 2014, 3:36 PM - Sonia Maria: I can come meet you at your office? I have to go home and pick up things that in stupidly bought and now need to return.
Jun 13, 2014, 3:36 PM - Sonia Maria: And after that, was planning on staying out a bit w Alea
Jun 13, 2014, 3:40 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Yes, come!
Jun 13, 2014, 3:50 PM - Sonia Maria: :)
Jun 13, 2014, 3:59 PM - Sonia Maria: I'll let you know when I am heading over
Jun 13, 2014, 4:45 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Ok cool!
Jun 13, 2014, 5:19 PM - Sonia Maria: On my way!
Jun 13, 2014, 5:47 PM - Sonia Maria: I'm here. I'm sorry but I really have to use toilet. Do you mind if I go up?
Jun 13, 2014, 5:48 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Come up
Jun 13, 2014, 5:48 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: 8th
Jun 13, 2014, 5:48 PM - Sonia Maria: Ok coming
Jun 13, 2014, 5:49 PM - Sonia Maria: Thanks
Jun 13, 2014, 9:47 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: It turns out I forgot my home keys at work #yay

Jun 13, 2014, 10:15 PM - Sonia Maria: Fuck, did you go all the way home to realize this
Jun 13, 2014, 10:15 PM - Sonia Maria: :/
Jun 13, 2014, 10:17 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I did
Jun 13, 2014, 10:17 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: But my neighbors are letting go through the window
Jun 13, 2014, 10:19 PM - Sonia Maria: :)) you have great neighbors
Jun 13, 2014, 10:33 PM - Sonia Maria: So you're home? I'm going to Caroline's now, came home since my phone died. For some reason, I'm so tired
Jun 13, 2014, 10:33 PM - Sonia Maria: Which is good.
Jun 13, 2014, 10:34 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Yeah, finally home. I guess I'll have to stop in Manhattan for my keys or sleep at yours on Sunday
Jun 13, 2014, 10:39 PM - Sonia Maria: Whatever you feel you want to do.
Jun 14, 2014, 7:33 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Are we on for 830?
Jun 14, 2014, 8:28 AM - Sonia Maria: Thanks for waking me up babe
Jun 14, 2014, 8:28 AM - Sonia Maria: I'm on my way now
Jun 16, 2014, 11:58 AM - Sonia Maria: My friend sent me this photo. Does this look like something your roommate would do?
Jun 16, 2014, 11:58 AM - Sonia Maria: <Media omitted>
Jun 16, 2014, 11:58 AM - Sonia Maria: He found it in wburg
Jun 16, 2014, 12:43 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Yes, thats his stuff. It looks like it says Art is trash on the right, which is his thing
Jun 16, 2014, 12:43 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: My brain is very fried
Jun 16, 2014, 12:43 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Are you wfh?
Jun 16, 2014, 12:57 PM - Sonia Maria: Nice :)
Jun 16, 2014, 12:57 PM - Sonia Maria: I am.
Jun 16, 2014, 12:58 PM - Sonia Maria: My brain feels the same. I had a big breakfast this morning, which helped. I think I just need more sleep.
Jun 16, 2014, 12:58 PM - Sonia Maria: Helped a bit, I meant to say
Jun 16, 2014, 12:59 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I cant find the keys anywhere
Jun 16, 2014, 1:00 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I just went to vbar, but not there either
Jun 16, 2014, 1:00 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Did we do anything else on Friday?
Jun 16, 2014, 1:01 PM - Sonia Maria: No, just your office then vbar. And then walked to the train.
Jun 16, 2014, 1:02 PM - Sonia Maria: Where do you usually keep them? They must have fallen out or something
Jun 16, 2014, 1:04 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I went to the doctor on Friday, they may be there, I remember taking everything out of my pockets
Jun 16, 2014, 1:30 PM - Sonia Maria: You can call the office or just go if it's near ou
Jun 16, 2014, 1:30 PM - Sonia Maria: *you
Jun 16, 2014, 5:45 PM - Sonia Maria: Did you find them / do you feel any better?

Jun 16, 2014, 6:44 PM - Sonia Maria: Hmmm that's strange
Jun 16, 2014, 6:45 PM - Sonia Maria: But yes, that and some healthy meal will do. I also think it was a lack of proper food all of yesterday that has us feeling like this.
Jun 16, 2014, 7:01 PM - Sonia Maria: What we owe for the ride up to SMP
Jun 16, 2014, 7:02 PM - Sonia Maria: <Media omitted>

Jun 18, 2014, 1:21 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Sorry I havent been more communicative
Jun 18, 2014, 1:21 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Ive been feeling a need for a lot of alone time
Jun 18, 2014, 1:25 PM - Sonia Maria: It's cool, don't worry
Jun 18, 2014, 3:14 PM - Sonia Maria: Are you thinking of going to Rich's dinner tonight?
Jun 18, 2014, 3:26 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I didnt know that was happening, so I guess Im not

Jun 18, 2014, 3:54 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: And if you want to go to the dinner, its close, no?
Jun 18, 2014, 3:57 PM - Sonia Maria: Ok. I'll let you know what I decide.
Jun 18, 2014, 4:48 PM - Sonia Maria: I'm just going to the dinner later. Enjoy your time
Jun 18, 2014, 4:51 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Oh ok
Jun 18, 2014, 4:52 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Is everything alright though?
Jun 18, 2014, 4:52 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I mean... with me?
Jun 18, 2014, 5:02 PM - Sonia Maria: Yeah
Jun 18, 2014, 5:03 PM - Sonia Maria: Im just having a really shit day
Jun 18, 2014, 5:03 PM - Sonia Maria: So idk I don't want to rub my bad mood off on others
Jun 18, 2014, 5:08 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Hm, ok
Jun 18, 2014, 5:09 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Maybe I can come see you at the dinner? When are you planning to go?
Jun 18, 2014, 5:10 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I don't know, I'd like to see you
Jun 18, 2014, 5:16 PM - Sonia Maria: I'm not sure if I want to go anywhere tonight to be honest
Jun 18, 2014, 5:16 PM - Sonia Maria: I think I may stay home
Jun 18, 2014, 5:17 PM - Sonia Maria: Don't worry about me, really. Just do your thing and enjoy your time w your friends
Jun 18, 2014, 5:18 PM - Sonia Maria: If I leave to go somewhere, I'll let you know

Jun 18, 2014, 5:29 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I'll call you later
Jun 18, 2014, 7:07 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: By the way, my doctor called. I dont have cancer :)
Jun 18, 2014, 7:36 PM - Sonia Maria: I knew you would be ok
Jun 18, 2014, 7:36 PM - Sonia Maria: But it's still great news
Jun 18, 2014, 7:52 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Thanks :) Are you feeling a bit better?
Jun 18, 2014, 7:55 PM - Sonia Maria: I am. I spoke to my mother, which I really needed to do. Some financial issues occurred this past week at my apartment (really too long to explain via text) and just ongoing frustration with my job, two components of my life that I value (where I live, what I do with my life) are just not in the right place. I just let negativity get the best of me, and speaking to her just made me realize this. Anyway, I'm ranting, but I do feel better.
Jun 18, 2014, 7:55 PM - Sonia Maria: Thanks for asking
Jun 18, 2014, 7:58 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Fuck, Im sorry. I hope your apt stuff is more or less in order. Lets talk later so that you can explain to me better. And let me know if you are going out at all.
Jun 18, 2014, 8:05 PM - Sonia Maria: It's sorted. It's just incredibly fucked. But anyway, yeah, will explain later. I am getting work done now at my place. I plan on leaving around 9 to stop by the dinner. Depends on how much work I complete at that point
Jun 18, 2014, 8:05 PM - Sonia Maria: Are you in wburg now?
Jun 18, 2014, 8:18 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Ok, let me know. Yes, Im at spuyten duyvil
Jun 18, 2014, 9:16 PM - Sonia Maria: I'm finishing up here. I will be at the dinner in 30. How are things with you
Jun 18, 2014, 9:28 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Im still at this bar, let me know when you're in wburg
Jun 18, 2014, 9:53 PM - Sonia Maria: I'm here. Everyone asked if you're coming.
Jun 18, 2014, 9:56 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Im at spuyten duyvil w matt nuria and arnau
Jun 18, 2014, 9:56 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Where's the dinner?
Jun 18, 2014, 9:56 PM - Sonia Maria: 435 broadway
Jun 18, 2014, 10:18 PM - Sonia Maria: It would be nice if you came. I can also come meet you. But if not tonight bc it's getting late, then no stress.
Jun 18, 2014, 10:46 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Leaving the bar now
Jun 18, 2014, 10:47 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: You still there?
Jun 18, 2014, 10:47 PM - Sonia Maria: Yes I am
Jun 18, 2014, 10:47 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Comng
Jun 18, 2014, 10:48 PM - Sonia Maria: Ok :) it's 435 broadway. Broadway and hewes st. Call when outside bc it's a bit confusing
Jun 19, 2014, 12:13 AM - Sonia Maria: Thank you for coming babe... And for listening. I'm headed home back. See you tomo babe
Jun 19, 2014, 12:58 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: How are you doing today?
Jun 19, 2014, 12:58 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Have you decided anything?
Jun 19, 2014, 1:04 PM - Sonia Maria: I woke up a little frustrated. Things aren't sitting too well with me. I'm assuming you're talking about my apartment shitty situation. I've sent an email with what I should be receiving for the month from Alea and I haven't heard back. I'm also seeing if Raisa is free tomorrow eve so I can see her.
Jun 19, 2014, 1:05 PM - Sonia Maria: I mean I actually did a super simplified break down of the payment plan until next year. But obviously no one cares at this point except me.
Jun 19, 2014, 1:05 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Its fucked up enough to feel frustrated
Jun 19, 2014, 1:06 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Has she acknowledged she didnt pay?
Jun 19, 2014, 1:06 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Also, I do think talking w Raisa is a good idea
Jun 19, 2014, 1:11 PM - Sonia Maria: No, she hasn't. I Skyped her on Tuesday. And on the phone she still stated she used her cc and I asked her to send me records. She said she would talk to her father because she needs to go back and find them (?). This email I have though, when I basically demanded she give me any and all info regarding ConEd. It's all blatant lies. I am just surprised someone would elaborate so much.
Jun 19, 2014, 1:13 PM - Sonia Maria: But bottom line, she's not here. And there's nothing else I can do but take over responsibility. So I'm just going to stop dwelling and move forward.
Jun 19, 2014, 1:14 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Its really fucked up. I guess thats the smartest you can do.
Jun 19, 2014, 1:15 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Did you ever pay to her the bills though? Did she ask you guys to split it?
Jun 19, 2014, 1:15 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Even if she wasnt paying I mean
Jun 19, 2014, 1:20 PM - Sonia Maria: No. We were all accountable for separate bills (electricity, gas, internet). And she would just tell me she paid the bill and I trusted her. As I told you last night, she could have said something if she couldn't afford it. I would have stepped in and helped. The whole situation is also just so strange.
Jun 19, 2014, 1:20 PM - Sonia Maria: :/
Jun 19, 2014, 1:20 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Have you talked w Mathias?
Jun 19, 2014, 1:21 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: What does he think?
Jun 19, 2014, 1:27 PM - Sonia Maria: He is also shocked about it. And he also said she would tell him the bill was paid for too. He is actually the one who found the notice on Monday. He is giving me half what I payed yesterday today. I think (hope) he will contribute each month. He seems reliable and it will show me a lot if he actually gives me that half today. He also just keeps thanking me about handling the situation. Idk, I'm just annoyed.
Jun 19, 2014, 1:27 PM - Sonia Maria: *paid
Jun 19, 2014, 1:30 PM - Sonia Maria: Anyway, this is a shit load of information. Haha. I hope I can see you later. My mother also called me this morning going on a rant about Felipe taking over the Spanish throne. At that point, I realized you guys should probably meet at some point soon.
Jun 19, 2014, 4:07 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Ok, so whats your plan today? Lets meet no?
Jun 19, 2014, 4:20 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Oh god the Felipe shit, dont get me started
Jun 19, 2014, 4:56 PM - Sonia Maria: Yeah
Jun 19, 2014, 4:56 PM - Sonia Maria: I plan on going to park slope and then seeing you.
Jun 19, 2014, 4:57 PM - Sonia Maria: You didn't have plans, right?
Jun 19, 2014, 5:08 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: No, not really
Jun 19, 2014, 5:09 PM - Sonia Maria: Ok
Jun 19, 2014, 5:10 PM - Sonia Maria: Honestly I'm getting a little weird vibe from you, like you want some space
Jun 19, 2014, 5:10 PM - Sonia Maria: Like, we don't need to see one another.
Jun 19, 2014, 5:10 PM - Sonia Maria: ^ I'm saying that.
Jun 19, 2014, 5:10 PM - Sonia Maria: I won't be offended, either.
Jun 19, 2014, 5:12 PM - Sonia Maria: And yeah, right now, I'd rather not.
Jun 19, 2014, 5:17 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Uh where is this coming from? but I just told you to meet up
Jun 19, 2014, 5:17 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: You'd rather not what?
Jun 19, 2014, 5:24 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Sorry, it sounded too cold. I think we better talk in person about this kind of stuff. I would like to see you today
Jun 19, 2014, 5:45 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: (Shit, Im sorry, I think Im overreacting cause I misunderstood your texts )
Jun 19, 2014, 5:52 PM - Sonia Maria: Idk what's going on really. So yeah, would be best to talk in person. But I don't want to argue and get hurt about another situation. Right now, I feel really weak and that I let people in my life too easily. This feeling hasn't occurred in a while. And I just don't know
Jun 19, 2014, 5:53 PM - Sonia Maria: I was just being super sensitive in prior texts
Jun 19, 2014, 5:53 PM - Sonia Maria: But hit me up when you're out of work, I'm home.
Jun 19, 2014, 5:54 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Yeah, lets meet up and chat later. So your gonna be in bushwick or park slope? Either way I can just come find you
Jun 19, 2014, 5:54 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: *you're
Jun 19, 2014, 5:54 PM - Sonia Maria: Bushwick
Jun 19, 2014, 5:55 PM - Sonia Maria: I don't want to be in buseick
Jun 19, 2014, 5:55 PM - Sonia Maria: Bushwick
Jun 19, 2014, 5:55 PM - Sonia Maria: So let's meet somewhere else.
Jun 19, 2014, 5:56 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Lets meet in ProspectHeights?
Jun 19, 2014, 5:57 PM - Sonia Maria: Ok. Should I bring my things for tomorrow? Like I don't know why I feel an actual distance from you right now. I think it's all in my head
Jun 19, 2014, 5:58 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Si, no?
Jun 19, 2014, 5:59 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Quedemos en Vanderbilt y GrandArmyPlaza?
Jun 19, 2014, 6:02 PM - Sonia Maria: Ok. I'm going to shower, I'll be there in an hour. Does this work for you?

Jun 24, 2014, 1:48 PM - Sonia Maria: FYI. My mother received a notice for all One World airlines – France Air Traffic Control is on strike effective today until 30 June, causing several delays for European flights. You should be fine, she just advised to check up on your flights to avoid stress the day you travel.
Jun 24, 2014, 1:58 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Oh wow I didnt know that! Thank you so much to you and your mom for looking it up!! So AA shouldnt be affected?

Jun 24, 2014, 2:27 PM - Sonia Maria: Yeah, my mother remembered that you were traveling and told me. AA shouldn't be. It's just for your awareness and because you have connecting flights. But you should be good :)

Jul 7, 2014, 9:25 AM - Sonia Maria: I'm looking back at my behavior this morning and you must surely think I'm insane, or volatile as you like to put it in nicer terms. I'm sorry about that! Also, I didn't receive any BM mail. Maybe it'll be arriving this week.
Jul 7, 2014, 11:21 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: You have your moods, yes, but that's fine. You can't be just happy all the time. I just need to know how to handle it to make you feel better when it happens.

Jul 7, 2014, 7:03 PM - Sonia Maria: Yeah I did
Jul 7, 2014, 7:16 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: How should we start?
Jul 7, 2014, 7:16 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Im gonna read all the emails now
Jul 7, 2014, 8:10 PM - Sonia Maria: Yeah I just got to mine. I'll be able to have a better look tomo. I only read through the emails regarding transport, and skimmed through the ones about neon lights. From what I understand, that order was already placed. Maybe it would be helpful to contact Naomi, she seems the most involved.
Jul 7, 2014, 8:13 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Naomi seems to be in charge of transportation. There is a doc with some overall budgetting but not very detailed yet. Aaron told me they would finishing it this week
Jul 7, 2014, 8:13 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: About costume and lights and stuff I think we should just do our thing
Jul 7, 2014, 8:13 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: We're flying so itll be difficult
Jul 7, 2014, 8:44 PM - Sonia Maria: Ok cool. I guess we can wait for that. And I agree with you, would be best to do our thing as I was looking up sites for costumes and what not. Shouldn't be an issue.

Jul 8, 2014, 5:02 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Maybe I wont go
Jul 8, 2014, 5:02 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Its at 7 to 10
Jul 8, 2014, 5:02 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Is everything alright at work though?
Jul 8, 2014, 5:23 PM - Sonia Maria: It could be much worse. It's just the politicking, arrogance, and sexism, I could go on... But I'm not really mood to get into detail. Things are fine.
Jul 8, 2014, 5:23 PM - Sonia Maria: You should go, sounds like fun!
Jul 8, 2014, 5:31 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: You need to tell me about this later or whenever I see you.
Jul 8, 2014, 5:31 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: If this makes you so unhappy there should be a way out for you.
Jul 8, 2014, 5:32 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: 😕 it sucks, Im sorry
Jul 8, 2014, 5:55 PM - Sonia Maria: I know... I will make a move but I don't want it to be half assed. I'm taking action I just applied for these coding courses. I want to be fully equipped when I leave and pursue better things. All's good. Just can't wait to leave the office today.
Jul 8, 2014, 7:15 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Thats probably a good idea. It sucks to be unmotivated at work. You'll do much better soon.
Jul 8, 2014, 7:15 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Have you left already?
Jul 8, 2014, 7:32 PM - Sonia Maria: I'm leaving now

Jul 9, 2014, 10:17 PM - Sonia Maria: Yeah. I'm kind of speechless. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Jul 10, 2014, 10:56 AM - Sonia Maria: My prose isn't as extended and poetic as yours, I am opposite you in that I think I better communicate in person. To be honest, I'm not sure I can see you immediately. Maybe tomorrow, or next week. I'm just confused right now I think.
Jul 10, 2014, 5:53 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Do you think you'll want to meet then?
Jul 10, 2014, 5:55 PM - Sonia Maria: I am planning to meet my friend today. Because, real talk, I need help and advice
Jul 10, 2014, 5:55 PM - Sonia Maria: Can we meet tomo?

Jul 13, 2014, 9:18 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Im sorry it ended up like this. I don't think you did anything wrong by telling me that, its great you said it. But I felt I was potentially overreacting and didnt want to end the weekend arguing. We'll talk tomorrow with a clear head. Sorry again.
Jul 13, 2014, 9:19 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: A weekend that has been great together, on the other hand.
Jul 14, 2014, 9:10 AM - Sonia Maria: I'm also sorry, I guess I didn't communicate what I was trying to say the right way
Jul 14, 2014, 9:10 AM - Sonia Maria: I also had a great weekend prior to that
Jul 14, 2014, 9:10 AM - Sonia Maria: I had no intention of ruining it
Jul 14, 2014, 12:34 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Lets forget about it by doing something cool and fun :)

Jul 14, 2014, 5:01 PM - Sonia Maria: Oh ok, I am still at work and will prob be here for another hour. I would, but I don't have clothes to change in or anything.
Jul 14, 2014, 5:01 PM - Sonia Maria: We can just meet tomorrow since you have an early start and want to go tonight.
Jul 14, 2014, 6:01 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Ok, that may make more sense actually. Lets do sth tomorrow (movies?) and go for a run wednesday morning then.
Jul 14, 2014, 6:35 PM - Sonia Maria: Ok, see you tomo
Jul 14, 2014, 9:22 PM - Sonia Maria: Did you go to capoeira?

Jul 17, 2014, 9:30 PM - Sonia Maria: ?**
Jul 17, 2014, 9:32 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: For example
Jul 17, 2014, 9:36 PM - Sonia Maria: Joking, but I understand, and I'm feeling the same level. I just finished meditating for an hour with my mother and some of her friends. So I'm feeling pretty relaxed and controlled.
Jul 17, 2014, 9:37 PM - Sonia Maria: Was there something following the "for example"
Jul 17, 2014, 9:38 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: No, just that
Jul 17, 2014, 9:39 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Nice! I didnt know you meditate with your mother
Jul 17, 2014, 9:40 PM - Sonia Maria: I did when I was a child. Her and my father taught me how to, after all. I suggested we do it today and then she created this small gathering.
Jul 17, 2014, 9:40 PM - Sonia Maria: I thought you had told me you made plans for today
Jul 17, 2014, 9:40 PM - Sonia Maria: I would have told you to join
Jul 17, 2014, 9:41 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I had, they fell off though
Jul 17, 2014, 9:41 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: No worries
Jul 17, 2014, 9:41 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: That would have been nice
Jul 17, 2014, 9:41 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Next time you do it
Jul 17, 2014, 9:42 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I tried to draw you
Jul 17, 2014, 9:42 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Its been terrible
Jul 17, 2014, 9:42 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: It doesnt look like you at all
Jul 17, 2014, 9:43 PM - Sonia Maria: Yes, you're coming! That would be a pretty awesome way for you guys to meet actually
Jul 17, 2014, 9:44 PM - Sonia Maria: Can you please show me!!
Jul 17, 2014, 9:44 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Its just not you
Jul 17, 2014, 9:45 PM - Sonia Maria: 
Jul 17, 2014, 9:46 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: <Media omitted>
Jul 17, 2014, 9:46 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Not you
Jul 17, 2014, 9:46 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I basically forgot how to draw anything and I just mess around
Jul 17, 2014, 9:47 PM - Sonia Maria: She reminds me of my alter ego
Jul 17, 2014, 9:47 PM - Sonia Maria: Ophelia
Jul 17, 2014, 9:47 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Oohoo
Jul 17, 2014, 9:48 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Thats interestig
Jul 17, 2014, 9:51 PM - Sonia Maria: We can pretend that's what you had in mind!
Jul 17, 2014, 9:51 PM - Sonia Maria: ;)
Jul 17, 2014, 9:55 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Lets do that
Jul 17, 2014, 9:56 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: 😅
Jul 17, 2014, 9:59 PM - Sonia Maria: Btw, I started filling Dina's list of items out, she got the list from a previous burner, there are 283 items! But a lot of things I would have not thought out (i.e.: chemical hand warmers) and that was listed as a "must". Idk if she's given you access yet, but there are a few things there that list REI as the location to buy, so it's a good idea to stop by tomo.
Jul 17, 2014, 10:00 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: It doesnt look like I do
Jul 17, 2014, 10:01 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Can you print it tmw and we'll have to check it out when there?
Jul 17, 2014, 10:04 PM - Sonia Maria: Yeah, she hasn't responded.
Jul 17, 2014, 10:04 PM - Sonia Maria: Will do!
Jul 17, 2014, 10:05 PM - Sonia Maria: Oh and
Jul 17, 2014, 10:05 PM - Sonia Maria: This: http://m.noisey.vice.com/blog/catey-shaw-brooklyn-girls-video
Jul 17, 2014, 10:05 PM - Sonia Maria: Is fucking disgusting.
Jul 17, 2014, 10:05 PM - Sonia Maria: It's funny because you would think that Brooklyn already reached its pinnacle but it's still peaking
Jul 17, 2014, 10:05 PM - Sonia Maria: And we can both go to sleep on that note, haha.
Jul 17, 2014, 10:10 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Puaj
Jul 17, 2014, 10:10 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Dont send me this shit
Jul 17, 2014, 10:10 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Too many awful and terrible news in the world today to end with this
Jul 17, 2014, 10:12 PM - Sonia Maria: Oh no, agreed!
Jul 17, 2014, 10:13 PM - Sonia Maria: Something to lift your spirit
Jul 17, 2014, 10:13 PM - Sonia Maria: <Media omitted>

Jul 18, 2014, 2:32 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Endless!
Jul 18, 2014, 2:32 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: XD

Jul 18, 2014, 3:34 PM - Sonia Maria: I just wanted to check time because my friend asked to meet during the day.
Jul 18, 2014, 3:34 PM - Sonia Maria: That's quite deep, isn't it? I'm still down. We can further discuss when we meet today
Jul 18, 2014, 5:53 PM - Sonia Maria: Heading over
Jul 18, 2014, 5:55 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Cool
Jul 18, 2014, 6:18 PM - Sonia Maria: Here
Jul 18, 2014, 6:18 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Want to come up?
Jul 18, 2014, 6:18 PM - Sonia Maria: Sure I also have to use toilet
Jul 18, 2014, 6:18 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Cool
Jul 18, 2014, 6:18 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: 8th
Jul 19, 2014, 9:53 AM - Sonia Maria: I'm not going to BM. And this is over, on my end.
Jul 19, 2014, 9:53 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Can I come find you and talk?
Jul 19, 2014, 9:54 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I need to talk with you in person
Jul 19, 2014, 9:57 AM - Sonia Maria: Not right now. I'm pretty sad and emotional
Jul 19, 2014, 9:59 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I know, but whenever. Later today, tomorrow.
Jul 19, 2014, 10:00 AM - Sonia Maria: I mean, sure. To discuss what exactly? Situations like these make me pretty heartless
Jul 19, 2014, 10:00 AM - Sonia Maria: To discuss why you don't want to be with me? Id rather not.
Jul 19, 2014, 10:02 AM - Sonia Maria: I just wish I had known about all of this while it was happening, that's all. And you could have communicated that as it was happening. I don't want to hear more about why this was not working
Jul 19, 2014, 10:03 AM - Sonia Maria: Especially coming from a person who preaches about openness and transparency
Jul 19, 2014, 10:04 AM - Sonia Maria: There was a lack of that. And I'm not going to continue with a person who has so much doubt with someone whilst masking that doubt and continuing to create some kind of future with that very person
Jul 19, 2014, 10:05 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I don't think I've hidden anything from you. Whenever there have been problems, we've discussed them
Jul 19, 2014, 10:06 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: But I don't want to be talking about doubts in a relationship all the time, but rather what keeps us together.
Jul 19, 2014, 10:07 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Now I felt the need to share those doubts with you and asked you for time to think
Jul 19, 2014, 10:07 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: All these plans made it obvious to me that I needed this
Jul 19, 2014, 10:10 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Precisely because of how serious all these plans were, I need to share w you my doubts and to understand them myself
Jul 19, 2014, 10:12 AM - Sonia Maria: To be honest, I think it's quite pathetic that BM became a reason to instill doubt about our relationship. But those doubts must have been deeply rooted and past the fav that we planned to do BM. Which is fine. But, clearly, right now, this (you and I) is just not working.
Jul 19, 2014, 10:14 AM - Sonia Maria: *past the fact. But in any case, I regret planning and looking forward to such a life changing experience. And I don't know what has happened. And I wish I could turn back time and change it. But, fuck it, it's not happening. And that's life.
Jul 19, 2014, 10:17 AM - Sonia Maria: Also, I don't mean to hurt you, either. You're a great person and definitely have no intention to hurt me. But you obviously did. I just don't want you to think ever that I think you're a bad person. You're not. This situation just spiraled out of control. And maybe I'm talking out of pure emotional distress, I don't know. But I would rather you and I live free and happy than go through more pain.
Jul 19, 2014, 10:24 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: The last thing I want to do is to hurt you and cause us pain. But I've realized that a lot of arguments we had were purely my fault. And I had to look at why this was happening because you don't deserve this. You've been teaching me so much and been contributing so much to this relationship that I wanted to make sure I can keep up.
Jul 19, 2014, 10:25 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: And maybe Im just not brave enought to face a life changing experience without guarantees that it won't hurt us.
Jul 19, 2014, 10:25 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: And yes, thats a bit pathetic, as you say.
Jul 19, 2014, 10:26 AM - Sonia Maria: It is. Because going through turmoil and fixing that is part of being in a relationship.
Jul 19, 2014, 10:26 AM - Sonia Maria: Period.
Jul 19, 2014, 10:28 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I know, which is why I brought this up yesterday.
Jul 19, 2014, 10:29 AM - Sonia Maria: Well, you had an incredibly bad way of bringing it up. I have spoken to numerous people about yesterday, and your behavior without a doubt was screaming that you wanted to end this relationship.
Jul 19, 2014, 10:30 AM - Sonia Maria: And that's what I gathered. And I realized I am not going to sit here and wait for more damage to be done.
Jul 19, 2014, 10:30 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: You matter to me, and I don't know how to do things the right way.
Jul 19, 2014, 10:31 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: That's probably fair.
Jul 19, 2014, 10:31 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: But I still need to talk with you.
Jul 19, 2014, 11:26 AM - Sonia Maria: I just don't really see a point in meeting because it will get us both more
Jul 19, 2014, 11:26 AM - Sonia Maria: *hurt us
Jul 19, 2014, 11:27 AM - Sonia Maria: What do you have to tell me?
Jul 19, 2014, 11:28 AM - Sonia Maria: To be honest I was really happy yesterday, and this really put me in a state of shock. I've shared so much with you and it's sad how someone can just decide to give that up
Jul 19, 2014, 11:28 AM - Sonia Maria: Like it is meaningless
Jul 19, 2014, 11:29 AM - Sonia Maria: I've been in this situation before, but sadly this is deeper. And the best way for me to move forward is letting go and not really being in close contact
Jul 19, 2014, 11:29 AM - Sonia Maria: So, I'm sorry but I don't want to meet.
Jul 19, 2014, 11:48 AM - Sonia Maria: I'm also not being irrational right now, I'm re-reading this convo and it's clear that we are unstable and not meant for one another right now
Jul 19, 2014, 11:51 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: No, I understand, it makes sense. It is true that we are unstable and seeing each other right now may not be the best. I agree, and I can wait to be calmer. But whatever it happens, I don't think it's worth what we've shared to only say what we have to say on whatsapp.
Jul 19, 2014, 11:53 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Also, this is why I want to see you and talk, because Im not giving anything up like it's meaningless. What we've lived until now matters too much to me.
Jul 19, 2014, 11:53 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: But I understand it can't be right now.
Jul 19, 2014, 11:58 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: But Im also asking you to not give me up like this. I asked you for some time to think, and before saying you never want to see me again, I wish I had an opportunity for that.
Jul 19, 2014, 11:58 AM - Sonia Maria: Yeah, I mean this all sounds like we are running in circles. Like the language used is so dramatic and unnecessary. Bottom line, YOU don't want this to continue for several reasons and doubts and I'm ending it for you because you won't do it yourself. Don't understand the point of vocalizing in person. And I understand, sure. Let's meet in person and end it. In that case, let's meet ASAP
Jul 19, 2014, 1:42 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: But this is not how I want to talk, and just end it out of anger like this. I'd like to talk with you and explain myself and what I tried to say yesterday, and hope you can understand me. You're right, we're emotionally distressed right now, and if this is just going to be anger, I'd rather wait.
Jul 19, 2014, 1:45 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Im aware what Im asking you is difficult.
Jul 19, 2014, 1:53 PM - Sonia Maria: It's not purely out of anger. It's out of me realizing that I want to be with someone who truly values and appreciates me, no matter how deep my imperfections may run. I really only wanted this to be something great. I'll hear what you have to say, but my decision is made and I won't fall back on it. I guess I'll just let you know when to meet.
Jul 19, 2014, 2:30 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I want to be with you if I learn to truly value and appreciate every single aspect of you, if I learn to work and communicate those things that need work, and this is what I need to figure out, because I've clearly been unable to. I also wanted this to be something great. You are the only person I dared to project myself into the future with since years ago. This is what this is about. But I understand you have the right to not want to be in that position. Let me know if you want to talk in the next few days. I won't push you.
Jul 19, 2014, 5:26 PM - Sonia Maria: To be completely honest, even if we were to jump back from this and be "decide to be together", I don't think I would follow through. The main reason is that I am an advocate of realness and, fucksake, if you are feeling like this is not what you want, fucking communicate! It could all be so simple in that aspect. I've actually realized I really want to get this over and we should just meet now. I don't think I want to hold this off until later
Jul 19, 2014, 5:40 PM - Sonia Maria: Are you in BK or at the beach? I'm going to be in Bushwick in 30min, can we meet and put closure to this
Jul 19, 2014, 5:42 PM - Sonia Maria: also, side note, this "needing time to think"
Jul 19, 2014, 5:42 PM - Sonia Maria: Just be assertive and make your mind up
Jul 19, 2014, 5:56 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Ok. Im in Prospect Heights. Where / when do we meet?
Jul 19, 2014, 6:30 PM - Sonia Maria: I'm in Bushwick. I just got to mine.
Jul 19, 2014, 6:48 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Itll be 715 when I get there
Jul 19, 2014, 6:48 PM - Sonia Maria: Ok
Jul 19, 2014, 7:12 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Im downstairs
Jul 19, 2014, 7:41 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: My battery si dying
Jul 19, 2014, 7:41 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Ill wait and call again in a bit
Jul 19, 2014, 8:15 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Let me know when you get this so that I know that you're ok at least
Jul 19, 2014, 8:44 PM - Sonia Maria: I fell asleep
Jul 19, 2014, 8:54 PM - Sonia Maria: You're coming now?
Jul 19, 2014, 8:59 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Yes
Jul 19, 2014, 9:06 PM - Sonia Maria: Ok
Jul 25, 2014, 11:39 AM - Sonia Maria: Franc, I've noticed changes on the BM Group's Google doc, my name is highlighted. I wanted to speak to you in person about this. Have you spoken on my behalf to anyone? I am confused.
Jul 25, 2014, 11:49 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Lisa asked me about leaving and I told her you weren't sure whether you were coming. She changed it herself. I didn't give her any more details. Please don't feel like I'm doing this without your consent. It was just a question she asked.
Jul 25, 2014, 11:53 AM - Sonia Maria: Why am I not included in that email?
Jul 25, 2014, 11:54 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I thought you wouldnt want to hear me saying anything to the group about BM. I dont know sonia, Im really sorry
Jul 25, 2014, 11:55 AM - Sonia Maria: I don't get why you are hiding, why can't we just be honest?
Jul 25, 2014, 11:55 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: It wasnt my intention to make you feel excluded, I just wanted to minimize pain
Jul 25, 2014, 11:55 AM - Sonia Maria: Ok.
Jul 25, 2014, 11:59 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I thought I had to say something to them to let her know at least we were thinking about it, but I didnt want you to feel that I was forcing you to say something publicly
Jul 25, 2014, 12:00 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I was hoping we would be able to talk about it soon
Jul 25, 2014, 12:00 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: You and me, I mean
Jul 25, 2014, 12:10 PM - Sonia Maria: I understand. I was planning to speak to you soon about both this and us, I just need some more time to think.
Jul 25, 2014, 12:11 PM - Sonia Maria: I just saw that and wanted to know what was going on. So you have said that I am not sure if I am going now, correct?
Jul 25, 2014, 12:18 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Yes. I just wanted to put them in the knowledge that things were moving for us.
Jul 25, 2014, 12:18 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Alsoo, totally understand if you need more time. Don't feel pressured please.
Jul 25, 2014, 2:02 PM - Sonia Maria: Can I just say one thing and I won't add on until we meet? Burning Man, for me, was supposed to be an experience of growth, self discovery, and happiness. About me. It was never about "us", I had plans to go prior to "us". You, one who values aloneness, asked me to join you. From then on, it was portrayed as you and I going to the camp as an "us". I don't feel as though I am seen as an individual, rather a couple. Now, this opportunity to go on a beautiful journey is affected by whether I want to be with you or not. I feel so tight and constrained. I want to be free. This opportunity has been taken away from me. And it frustrates me and brings me confusion. This is why I need more time to think. That is all I have to say, just keep that in mind and we will approach this more calmly and rationally when we discuss "you and I".
Jul 25, 2014, 2:30 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I understand what you mean, I think we both relate to this in a way. We may have jumped too much into this "us" regarding BM. I'll think about this. Let's talk about it in person whenever is time.
Jul 26, 2014, 6:52 AM - Sonia Maria: Franc, you are free. Free from me. Enjoy burning man and may it bring you an incredible perspective on life.
Jul 26, 2014, 6:52 AM - Sonia Maria: :)
Jul 26, 2014, 7:40 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I love you, Sonia, and I respect your decision. If that's what it is, I would love to say bye in person though.
Jul 26, 2014, 7:53 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I want to apologize in person
Jul 26, 2014, 10:04 AM - Sonia Maria: You respect my decision haha
Jul 26, 2014, 10:04 AM - Sonia Maria: Thank you
Jul 26, 2014, 10:04 AM - Sonia Maria: Sure
Jul 26, 2014, 10:04 AM - Sonia Maria: Let's meet in person
Jul 26, 2014, 10:05 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: When is good for you?
Jul 26, 2014, 10:05 AM - Sonia Maria: Weeks from now
Jul 26, 2014, 10:06 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I dont understand what Ive done
Jul 26, 2014, 10:06 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: For you to have such bad feelings towards me
Jul 26, 2014, 10:06 AM - Sonia Maria: Wait I actually have to discuss with you, you mentioned reimbursing me for my flight
Jul 26, 2014, 10:07 AM - Sonia Maria: That needs to happen.
Jul 26, 2014, 10:07 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I will, if thats what you want
Jul 26, 2014, 10:08 AM - Sonia Maria: I do
Jul 26, 2014, 10:09 AM - Sonia Maria: How is that going to happen
Jul 26, 2014, 10:09 AM - Sonia Maria: And you can also have them remove me from the google doc group
Jul 26, 2014, 10:09 AM - Sonia Maria: The group google doc *
Jul 26, 2014, 10:09 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: However you prefer, paypal, venmo, cash.
Jul 26, 2014, 10:10 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Can we please meet and talk?
Jul 26, 2014, 10:10 AM - Sonia Maria: I don't need to see that email either
Jul 26, 2014, 10:10 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: What email?
Jul 26, 2014, 10:10 AM - Sonia Maria: The email you'll send to the group telling them I'm no liger going
Jul 26, 2014, 10:11 AM - Sonia Maria: *longer
Jul 26, 2014, 10:11 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I dont want to end this Sonia. Im really sorry Im not a better person.
Jul 26, 2014, 10:12 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I thought you wanted me to vocalize my doubts, but as soon as I did, everything went to shit immediately.
Jul 26, 2014, 10:15 AM - Sonia Maria: No it didn't
Jul 26, 2014, 10:15 AM - Sonia Maria: I respect you for your honesty
Jul 26, 2014, 10:15 AM - Sonia Maria: And that's exactly what I wanted to hear
Jul 26, 2014, 10:16 AM - Sonia Maria: But then yesterday, the hiding thing. That showed me, you didn't really learn.
Jul 26, 2014, 10:16 AM - Sonia Maria: Finding out that way hurt me more
Jul 26, 2014, 10:16 AM - Sonia Maria: And then I realized. WHY am I agonizing myself over this
Jul 26, 2014, 10:16 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Last week you told you were supersure you didnt want to come with me
Jul 26, 2014, 10:16 AM - Sonia Maria: It could all be so simple
Jul 26, 2014, 10:17 AM - Sonia Maria: And now it's simple
Jul 26, 2014, 10:17 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Im sorry, teach me, really, I want to be better with you
Jul 26, 2014, 10:17 AM - Sonia Maria: I love you and want to work and go through shit and fight and cry for you
Jul 26, 2014, 10:17 AM - Sonia Maria: But if you don't
Jul 26, 2014, 10:17 AM - Sonia Maria: I will let you go
Jul 26, 2014, 10:17 AM - Sonia Maria: And that's it
Jul 26, 2014, 10:18 AM - Sonia Maria: So simple
Jul 26, 2014, 10:18 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: But I do!!
Jul 26, 2014, 10:18 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: This is what we are doing right now!! Going thhrough shit and working on it!
Jul 26, 2014, 10:18 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I understand what I do was wrong and it made you feel I was hiding from you
Jul 26, 2014, 10:19 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: My intention wasnt that one, but I should just simply told you before
Jul 26, 2014, 10:19 AM - Sonia Maria: I'm not looking into it and taking it personally
Jul 26, 2014, 10:19 AM - Sonia Maria: Seriously
Jul 26, 2014, 10:20 AM - Sonia Maria: I am looking at it for what it is
Jul 26, 2014, 10:20 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: We were in very low communication, and having told you I thought we should tell them you were thinking about it, I thought that would have made things worse
Jul 26, 2014, 10:21 AM - Sonia Maria: Our communication. The detriment of everything.
Jul 26, 2014, 10:22 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I dont know what to say. I honestly thought I was doing the right thing, now I understand I didnt
Jul 26, 2014, 10:22 AM - Sonia Maria: It's fine. Don't stress over this
Jul 26, 2014, 10:23 AM - Sonia Maria: Stress over the months we wasted this past year.
Jul 26, 2014, 10:23 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Why wasted? Why? This has taught me so much, has filled me with emotions, with a desire to be a better person
Jul 26, 2014, 10:23 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I dont regret anything these last months
Jul 26, 2014, 10:24 AM - Sonia Maria: Also. My
Flight was $225. My paypal is my email.
Jul 26, 2014, 10:24 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Except hurting you so bad the last few weeks
Jul 26, 2014, 10:29 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Sonia, Im sorry I didnt communicate better before. Im sorry I made you feel I was hiding things from you, that I wasnt valuing you enough. I know it was wrong, and I want to learn how to do it better next time.
Jul 26, 2014, 10:30 AM - Sonia Maria: There's not much to learn
Jul 26, 2014, 10:30 AM - Sonia Maria: Just communicate better
Jul 26, 2014, 10:30 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Ive never felt so much pain for the possibility of losing somebody. I really want to work and go through shit and be better.
Jul 26, 2014, 10:31 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Well, but that doesnt happen immediately just wishing for it. It happens fucking up and learning from it.
Jul 26, 2014, 10:31 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I want to try
Jul 26, 2014, 10:33 AM - Sonia Maria: Yeah, well we fully accomplished the fucking it up part
Jul 26, 2014, 10:35 AM - Sonia Maria: And yeah, you realize now, meaningful shit take TIME and EFFORT to build
Jul 26, 2014, 10:35 AM - Sonia Maria: You're constantly speaking of you not wanting to work for t
Jul 26, 2014, 10:35 AM - Sonia Maria: Or not finding it in you to
Jul 26, 2014, 10:35 AM - Sonia Maria: Again: why am I agonizing myself? It could all be so simple
Jul 26, 2014, 10:36 AM - Sonia Maria: You don't want it, I let it go
Jul 26, 2014, 10:36 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Not wanting to work for us? Why are you saying this?
Jul 26, 2014, 10:36 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: How dont I want this?
Jul 26, 2014, 10:37 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Meaningful shit take time and effort, yes! I want this!
Jul 26, 2014, 10:38 AM - Sonia Maria: There.
Jul 26, 2014, 10:38 AM - Sonia Maria: <Media omitted>
Jul 26, 2014, 10:39 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: But thats a natural worry, the worry that things may be bigger than you think in the future.
Jul 26, 2014, 10:39 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: But what I said was that I was scared
Jul 26, 2014, 10:40 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Are you never scared of things not going well?
Jul 26, 2014, 10:41 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: You asked to be honest, and this is as transparent as I felt. Not everything is perfect, but I still want it, I still want to try and burn myself
Jul 26, 2014, 10:45 AM - Sonia Maria: I know, I was lied to for a month due to fear. Fear is such a troublesome thing, it changes people. Like it did to you
Jul 26, 2014, 10:45 AM - Sonia Maria: Well
Jul 26, 2014, 10:45 AM - Sonia Maria: Let's see how you feel after BM
Jul 26, 2014, 10:45 AM - Sonia Maria: About wanting to try with me
Jul 26, 2014, 10:46 AM - Sonia Maria: Fear even made you hurt me, something you said you wouldn't do
Jul 26, 2014, 10:47 AM - Sonia Maria: Uncontrollable obviously
Jul 26, 2014, 10:47 AM - Sonia Maria: But whatever, it happened
Jul 26, 2014, 10:47 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I understand that now, fear is always the problem
Jul 26, 2014, 10:49 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I didnt think I lied to you, I was trying to figure out things before giving you confusing messages
Jul 26, 2014, 10:50 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I guess I did by omission
Jul 26, 2014, 10:50 AM - Sonia Maria: You were hiding, just as you did with that fucking email that I saw yesterday
Jul 26, 2014, 10:50 AM - Sonia Maria: Don't you see that?
Jul 26, 2014, 10:51 AM - Sonia Maria: Be transparent.
Jul 26, 2014, 10:51 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I understand that now
Jul 26, 2014, 10:51 AM - Sonia Maria: SIMPLE
Jul 26, 2014, 10:51 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Help me!
Jul 26, 2014, 10:51 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: No, its not that easy
Jul 26, 2014, 10:51 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Im a mess
Jul 26, 2014, 10:51 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Its really difficult for mr
Jul 26, 2014, 10:51 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: for me
Jul 26, 2014, 10:51 AM - Sonia Maria: Clearly. You made this into a fucking mess
Jul 26, 2014, 10:51 AM - Sonia Maria: It's not only your fault
Jul 26, 2014, 10:52 AM - Sonia Maria: But right now, it's like I don't even know who you are.
Jul 26, 2014, 10:53 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: You know. Im just very complicated, and this has always made things difficult with people. Ive been trying to be more stable and not confuse, but its difficult
Jul 26, 2014, 10:54 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: You see how I am about every other thing in my life, my mind goes all over the place all the time
Jul 26, 2014, 10:57 AM - Sonia Maria: Yes I do. I see this. I'm not judging. I'm complex as he'll myself.
Jul 26, 2014, 10:57 AM - Sonia Maria: *hell
Jul 26, 2014, 10:57 AM - Sonia Maria: But I definitely see it now
Jul 26, 2014, 10:58 AM - Sonia Maria: I still love you regardless
Jul 26, 2014, 10:58 AM - Sonia Maria: And care about you and I want you to be happy
Jul 26, 2014, 10:58 AM - Sonia Maria: You said you haven't felt truly  happy all year
Jul 26, 2014, 10:58 AM - Sonia Maria: ! That is sad
Jul 26, 2014, 11:00 AM - Sonia Maria: BM will make you happy
Jul 26, 2014, 11:00 AM - Sonia Maria: I still don't get why you asked me to go with you haha
Jul 26, 2014, 11:00 AM - Sonia Maria: Its laughable to me now
Jul 26, 2014, 11:00 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I havent euphoric like other times, but Ive felt for the first time in a long time I was becoming more complete emotionally, I could care about somebody who wasnt myself
Jul 26, 2014, 11:00 AM - Sonia Maria: Because it was so stupid. Knowing who you are and how you are
Jul 26, 2014, 11:01 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I dont know Sonia, yeah, it wasnt the smartest thing in perspective
Jul 26, 2014, 11:01 AM - Sonia Maria: But you got excited about us
Jul 26, 2014, 11:01 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I fucking did
Jul 26, 2014, 11:01 AM - Sonia Maria: And didn't think, you were impulsive
Jul 26, 2014, 11:01 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I am impulsive
Jul 26, 2014, 11:02 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I should have thought about it more
Jul 26, 2014, 11:02 AM - Sonia Maria: Btw, you know that pain you mentioned of losing someone? That fucking deep and horrid feeling that feels like your guts are being turned around inside of you except you feel no pain? That's fucking love!
Jul 26, 2014, 11:02 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: In the beginning I think you were planning to go w another camp, and since it wasnt going to work out, I thought it was natural you came w me
Jul 26, 2014, 11:03 AM - Sonia Maria: *no literal pain (in your guts)
Jul 26, 2014, 11:03 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Shit
Jul 26, 2014, 11:03 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I love you
Jul 26, 2014, 11:03 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I love you
Jul 26, 2014, 11:03 AM - Sonia Maria: And yeah, I know. Whatever, BM is no longer happening in  my mind. Next year.
Jul 26, 2014, 11:05 AM - Sonia Maria: BM could have brought us closer. There was too much negativity.
Jul 26, 2014, 11:05 AM - Sonia Maria: This is the right decision.
Jul 26, 2014, 11:05 AM - Sonia Maria: BM has been decided
Jul 26, 2014, 11:05 AM - Sonia Maria: And now, us.
Jul 26, 2014, 11:06 AM - Sonia Maria: What happens now Franc
Jul 26, 2014, 11:07 AM - Sonia Maria: I want you to realize, that you created some relation between BM and is
Jul 26, 2014, 11:07 AM - Sonia Maria: *us
Jul 26, 2014, 11:07 AM - Sonia Maria: That was not smart
Jul 26, 2014, 11:08 AM - Sonia Maria: Idk, never mind, I'm just confused, angry, hurt, sad.
Jul 26, 2014, 11:09 AM - Sonia Maria: Whatever, you can go to BM happy and carefree now as you wanted. I'll just talk to you sometime after that I guess. And that's my decision
Jul 26, 2014, 11:09 AM - Sonia Maria: *some time
Jul 26, 2014, 11:09 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I know I did that, and it wasnt smart, I understand
Jul 26, 2014, 11:10 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Im really sorry. I also feel embarrassed, hurt in pain, I feel stupid
Jul 26, 2014, 11:11 AM - Sonia Maria: This is what life's for
Jul 26, 2014, 11:11 AM - Sonia Maria: To go through this shit
Jul 26, 2014, 11:11 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I know
Jul 26, 2014, 11:12 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Sometimes I forget, and then life hits you in the worst way to remind you
Jul 26, 2014, 11:13 AM - Sonia Maria: I kind of hate that I love you now. Because I don't want to let you go
Jul 26, 2014, 11:13 AM - Sonia Maria: It sucks.
Jul 26, 2014, 11:13 AM - Sonia Maria: But I have I
Jul 26, 2014, 11:13 AM - Sonia Maria: To
Jul 26, 2014, 11:13 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I dont want to lose you.
Jul 26, 2014, 11:14 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I hate myself for doing this to us. To you. You so much dont deserve this.
Jul 26, 2014, 11:14 AM - Sonia Maria: I know, it makes me sad
Jul 26, 2014, 11:14 AM - Sonia Maria: Really fucking sad
Jul 26, 2014, 11:17 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: It hurts to imagine my life without you in it. It just doesnt make sense. I cant think of that.
Jul 26, 2014, 11:17 AM - Sonia Maria: That will go away, with time
Jul 26, 2014, 11:17 AM - Sonia Maria: Btw, I have some of your books.
Jul 26, 2014, 11:23 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: What should we do about that?
Jul 26, 2014, 11:24 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: You can keep them, if you're ok with seeing me some day, I'll come pick them up
Jul 26, 2014, 11:25 AM - Sonia Maria: I'll have to see you eventually. I would have liked to discuss this in person, like can we be mature and actually meet and not cry our eyes out and talk? Idk.
Jul 26, 2014, 11:26 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I would have liked that too
Jul 26, 2014, 11:26 AM - Sonia Maria: It would be correct.
Jul 26, 2014, 11:26 AM - Sonia Maria: But idk honestly
Jul 26, 2014, 11:26 AM - Sonia Maria: We are just so emotional
Jul 26, 2014, 11:27 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I dont know either. I definitely cant promise to not cry.
Jul 26, 2014, 11:28 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: But I can talk if you want
Jul 26, 2014, 11:30 AM - Sonia Maria: I'm reading this convo, and I sound like I'm basically beating you with a bat. You have to understand it's out of pure anger. BUT, everything you wrote in that email. Everything was a fucking truth. And I really respect you and I am so happy you were able to do that
Jul 26, 2014, 11:37 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Thank you. I know its not malicious, I know I hurt you and this is the result, I understand. I wish I hadnt, but in reality, I think whatever happens, we are at least facing things the way they are. In quite a raw way, but at least we know where things stand.
Jul 26, 2014, 11:52 AM - Sonia Maria: My gut is telling me to see you. My gut has been through a lot of pain this week.
Jul 26, 2014, 11:53 AM - Sonia Maria: Anyway, I'm going to crown heights later, I'll drop off your books at your door.
Jul 26, 2014, 11:53 AM - Sonia Maria: Please note: I underlined stuff in your Chomsky book. I think I'll just order you a new one right now bc I feel bad about that / I want to keep that book bc it's the first book you ever gave me and I like that.
Jul 26, 2014, 11:56 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I'll get a new one, dont worry. I got back home, let me know when you want to come and I'll meet you downstairs. I understand if you want to make it quick, though I wish we could talk for a bit. So ley me know if you feel like doing that.
Jul 26, 2014, 12:10 PM - Sonia Maria: I will. And yes, we can speak. I owe you it to you to explain what is going on right now in terms of us and about BM.
Jul 26, 2014, 12:12 PM - Sonia Maria: In my mind and then you can share your thoughts
Jul 26, 2014, 12:13 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Great, I think we should do that. Uri and China are counting on my help with their moving at 5ish. You think you'll come before? I could do after that is done too.
Jul 26, 2014, 12:16 PM - Sonia Maria: I have a rooftop thing at that same time
Jul 26, 2014, 12:16 PM - Sonia Maria: I'm showering now and heading out after
Jul 26, 2014, 12:27 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Ok, Ill be here
Jul 26, 2014, 1:22 PM - Sonia Maria: Heading

Jul 26, 2014, 1:45 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Ok
Jul 26, 2014, 1:45 PM - Sonia Maria: Where are you
Jul 26, 2014, 1:46 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Home
Jul 26, 2014, 1:49 PM - Sonia Maria: I'm a few blocks away
Jul 26, 2014, 1:50 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: No rush, I was just wondering
Jul 26, 2014, 1:57 PM - Sonia Maria: I'm here
Jul 26, 2014, 1:58 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Coming
Jul 26, 2014, 6:11 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Here's the sun for you 
Jul 26, 2014, 6:17 PM - Sonia Maria: I know! And this rooftop is super white
Jul 26, 2014, 6:18 PM - Sonia Maria: I feel like how we did in that can
Jul 26, 2014, 6:18 PM - Sonia Maria: Cab*
Jul 26, 2014, 6:18 PM - Sonia Maria: Also, I can't get over how incredibly amazing the time we spent together today was
Jul 26, 2014, 6:19 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I know. It's been unbelievable.
Jul 26, 2014, 6:19 PM - Sonia Maria: Added onto last Saturday
Jul 26, 2014, 6:20 PM - Sonia Maria: Surreal
Jul 26, 2014, 6:20 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Thank you so much Sonia. I feel such a contradiction with how happy I feel right now.
Jul 26, 2014, 6:20 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Yeah
Jul 26, 2014, 6:20 PM - Sonia Maria: I know, I do too. But this is right and we both know it
Jul 26, 2014, 6:20 PM - Sonia Maria: We both feel relief
Jul 26, 2014, 6:20 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Agree
Jul 26, 2014, 10:21 PM - Sonia Maria: I know I don't want to add onto anything but I felt to happy with you today I just want to holding you right now. But I know we can't it's not happening but I love the state we are in a strange way
Jul 26, 2014, 10:21 PM - Sonia Maria: Want to be holding you **
Jul 26, 2014, 10:24 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I also really like the state we left things right now. I would love to be holding you too. In a way, my grandma thing has been pulling me down, but you and I has kept me afloat so much.
Jul 26, 2014, 10:24 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Thanks :))
Jul 26, 2014, 10:42 PM - Sonia Maria: :* I love you a lot and as complex people we need to find the simplicity in love and it's absolute beauty. We have reached such a beautiful state, you and me. Just wow. Now just let life take it's natural course
Jul 26, 2014, 10:51 PM - Sonia Maria: :)))
Jul 26, 2014, 11:21 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Yeah, let's keep this state beautiful, inspiring and free. Let's let it take its natural course :)) I love you too. Are you still on that rooftop?
Jul 26, 2014, 11:24 PM - Sonia Maria: Yes I am

Jul 26, 2014, 11:49 PM - Sonia Maria: Ok. No worries. Enjoy.
Jul 27, 2014, 12:05 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: :***
Jul 27, 2014, 2:58 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I love you
Jul 27, 2014, 3:08 AM - Sonia Maria: I love you
Jul 27, 2014, 3:09 AM - Sonia Maria: A whole fucking lot
Jul 27, 2014, 3:10 AM - Sonia Maria: Smile, what we have is sacred and beautiful and it got us to this point to realize
Jul 27, 2014, 3:11 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: :D I will. Thanks for everything.
Jul 27, 2014, 3:14 AM - Sonia Maria: You too!!!!
Jul 27, 2014, 11:58 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: With everything going on in my life right now and somehow I still feel blessed. I hope you still feel as great about this as we felt last night.
Jul 27, 2014, 12:42 PM - Sonia Maria: I still do. Definitely. I want to think that I'll no longer feel all that anguish now because we reached such a great point. It's helping me remain positive and I love that. I really wish I could be there for you... I know I can't but I'll always be here
Jul 27, 2014, 12:42 PM - Sonia Maria: :)
Jul 27, 2014, 12:45 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Thanks. Im there too for anything you need. It does help remain positive :)))
Jul 27, 2014, 12:46 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: What do you want to do with BM group? Want to try and remove yourself?
Jul 27, 2014, 12:46 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Also, Im still thinking of your $225 gift. We'll find something worth it.
Jul 27, 2014, 1:02 PM - Sonia Maria: I'll try to now. And then you'll message them after?
Jul 27, 2014, 1:03 PM - Sonia Maria: And take your time with that
Jul 27, 2014, 1:39 PM - Sonia Maria: I'm just emailing Lisa instead.
Jul 27, 2014, 1:47 PM - Sonia Maria: Bc I can't remove myself
Jul 27, 2014, 1:47 PM - Sonia Maria: 
Jul 27, 2014, 2:02 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Ok. Let me know how it and if you need me to do sth else.
Jul 27, 2014, 3:03 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I cant find my old phone! Are you sure you deleted the whole conversation?
Jul 27, 2014, 3:04 PM - Sonia Maria: I did. I did it out of anger this past week so I only have the convo since I message you on Friday about the Google doc
Jul 27, 2014, 3:04 PM - Sonia Maria: 
Jul 27, 2014, 3:04 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Aw
Jul 27, 2014, 3:05 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Im emailing what I have at least
Jul 27, 2014, 3:05 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Since Jan 28
Jul 27, 2014, 3:05 PM - Sonia Maria: Ok :/
Jul 27, 2014, 3:05 PM - Sonia Maria: I'm getting a little sad now actually, can you wait a bit and send it this week?
Jul 27, 2014, 3:05 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Shit, I just did, Im sorry
Jul 27, 2014, 3:06 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: :/ too late
Jul 27, 2014, 3:06 PM - Sonia Maria: It's ok
Jul 27, 2014, 3:07 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: But dont be sad. Life is beautiful, we're lucky to be who we are and have met each other.
Jul 27, 2014, 3:36 PM - Sonia Maria: I know. You're right.
Jul 27, 2014, 3:37 PM - Sonia Maria: I'm not sure if active communication right now is a smart idea. I need to process what's happening. I think you should too. And we can then figure it out some point soon.
Jul 27, 2014, 3:37 PM - Sonia Maria: What do you think?
Jul 27, 2014, 3:42 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I agree we should slow down communication, we both need to digest itm. Just wanted to make sure we're doing what we needed.
Jul 27, 2014, 3:42 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Sorry if I've messaged too much
Jul 27, 2014, 3:43 PM - Sonia Maria: No no no.
Jul 27, 2014, 3:43 PM - Sonia Maria: Not at all
Jul 27, 2014, 3:43 PM - Sonia Maria: It's just. We are in fact broken up.
Jul 27, 2014, 4:32 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I know. Its just I felt we needed to take care of a few things for it to make sense. But you're right lets talk a bit less from now on.
Jul 27, 2014, 9:37 PM - Sonia Maria: The depth of emotions I've been feeling in the past week truly scares me. But yes, we needed closure and now we can move forward. Take care.
Jul 27, 2014, 11:29 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: This has been really hard for me too. It feels like my whole life is resituating itself. Like it's derrailing, somehow :). Its all for good. Difficult and strange, but a sign that things are moving forward.
Jul 28, 2014, 4:46 PM - Sonia Maria: Sorry, but I need a favor, can you please fwd me the email you sent to Lorin and Saliha declining the wedding invite. My friends are starting to sorry out housing and I need to confirm my attendance. I also spoke to your BM camp and everything is cleared out now.
Jul 28, 2014, 4:46 PM - Sonia Maria: *sort out
Jul 28, 2014, 4:48 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Sure, Ill do that. I think I already sent it to you before sending it to them, but Ill forward it anyways just in case.
Jul 28, 2014, 4:49 PM - Sonia Maria: You sent me the message but not w their emails
Jul 28, 2014, 4:49 PM - Sonia Maria: I just want to use the actual message and respond on y own
Jul 28, 2014, 4:49 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I just did. Let me know if that works
Jul 28, 2014, 4:50 PM - Sonia Maria: It's fine. Thanks.
Jul 28, 2014, 4:51 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Cool
Jul 28, 2014, 6:45 PM - Sonia Maria: You know, when you sent that message last night, with a smile, I know it was a joke, but that really hurt me. It's showing me your true colors, that you wanted an end to it. At least that's what I felt after reading that.
Jul 28, 2014, 6:46 PM - Sonia Maria: Which is fine, whatever. Some things you just keep to yourself after I told you that I was feeling sad. Idk, it's whatever just need to get over it and move forward.
Jul 28, 2014, 6:59 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: It was a reference to how much I usually say that my life is derailing. It was not a smile as in Im happy we are going through all of this. Im really sorry it felt that bad, but I dont know why I have to keep justifying myself all the time, I dont think I deserve you to look at everything I do in bad light. Im sorry you felt that way. Im not going through the best of times myself, and it was just a blink at our complicity.
Jul 28, 2014, 7:00 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: A complicity that even when we are going through bad times, I can still feel there and value.
Jul 28, 2014, 7:22 PM - Sonia Maria: To justify yourself? I don't look at everything you do in a bad light. I guess I understand better now.
Jul 28, 2014, 7:22 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I meant "wink", not blink
Jul 28, 2014, 7:22 PM - Sonia Maria: Thanks for clarifying
Jul 28, 2014, 7:31 PM - Sonia Maria: And I'm not trying to say what you are doing is negative and you need to justify yourself. But I'm sensitive right now, that's all. Anyway, I'm sorry I brought it up let's just drop this.
Jul 28, 2014, 7:44 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Im sorry too. Its fine. I guess its normal we are feeling sensitive.
Jul 31, 2014, 11:22 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Even if its complicated, it makes me very happy to see you. I hope you have fun! Lets take a long walk in a few days :*
Aug 1, 2014, 7:46 AM - Sonia Maria: Thank you for coming to see me. It was hard not to center my whole night around those 5 minutes that I spent with you. I feel happy that you came. And we can meet again in a few days, for a walk. I miss everything about you.
Aug 1, 2014, 12:54 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I miss you too. Happy that you would let me into your life for a minute to say happy birthday. I hope you had fun. Lets talk soon these days. :**
Aug 1, 2014, 5:44 PM - Sonia Maria: Also, I'm sorry I didn't even ask about your grandmother, your surgery. I was in a weird shock mode when I saw you (a positive one). Times like these, you want nothing more than that one person. I hope things are going okay and you're remaining strong.
Aug 1, 2014, 5:47 PM - Sonia Maria: <3
Aug 1, 2014, 5:50 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Thank you Sonia. My grandma finally passed this morning. Im really sad, but accepted long time ago and Im happy my father can get some strange relieve. Too much suffering.
Aug 1, 2014, 5:52 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Don't worry, I understand, I was really just there for you and didnt expect to talk about me :) I hope you remain happy. Life is fucking hard, but totally worth it regardless.
Aug 1, 2014, 5:52 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: <3
Aug 1, 2014, 6:01 PM - Sonia Maria: I understand that state. Still always sad news though. All my love to you and your family.
Aug 1, 2014, 6:03 PM - Sonia Maria: And life is fucking difficult, but think about how fortified and enlightened you'll feel after this shitshow. It will be great. Life is also beautiful! And I'm trying my best to remain happy. I think the future is still bright for me. And for you, too.
Aug 1, 2014, 8:05 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Thank you. Its true, after this perfect shitstorm, it can only be better, thanks for the positivity. The future will be bright.
Aug 7, 2014, 5:41 PM - Sonia Maria: My last viewing is at 7. So I should be free by 730, latest. You can pick the place and I will meet you between 730-8.
Aug 7, 2014, 5:47 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Can I meet straight on prospect heights? Lets meet at Hot bird, and then we'll walk somewhere.
Aug 7, 2014, 5:47 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Its on Atlantic between vanderbilt and clinton
Aug 7, 2014, 5:47 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: 745?
Aug 7, 2014, 5:52 PM - Sonia Maria: Sure. See you then.
Aug 7, 2014, 5:54 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Cool. See you
Aug 7, 2014, 7:44 PM - Sonia Maria: I'm on Fulton and Classon. I'll be there in less than 10
Aug 9, 2014, 7:22 AM - Sonia Maria: Franc, I'm high. But you have touched my soul. You can feel it too, detach yourself from all physical form. Find your soul. We're not together, but I feel you with me.
Aug 9, 2014, 9:34 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: This made me happy :) You're amazing. I feel you with me.
Aug 9, 2014, 11:44 AM - Sonia Maria: I was in a very simple and happy place. I'm back on earth now. But that's the beauty of going on the journey of finding inner peace! I'm happy it made you feel good. Have a great weekend!
Aug 15, 2014, 6:48 PM - Sonia Maria: I love you. And I just want the best for both of us.
Aug 15, 2014, 7:02 PM - Sonia Maria: I have a harder shell that allows me to leap and make tough decisions. But deep down, I know we don't know what will happen with "us", but my feelings are incredibly strong and won't just wither away. I just don't want us to be stuck and we must continue to live.
Aug 15, 2014, 7:03 PM - Sonia Maria: That's all. And I wish we could be more in each other's lives right now. But we can't. I believe in the future, this will change.
Aug 15, 2014, 7:44 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I love you Sonia. I know are feelings are very intense now and it's difficult to talk and understand each other without letting emotions taking over everything. But I do feel you, I know you're trying to make the best happen. I'm very admired of your determination on this. I know as well that we can't be in each other's life right now, but we feel so strongly about one another, that we'll need to find a way to be part of each other. I don't know what will happen to 'us', but I want you to be happy and Im sorry I havent contributed much to your happiness at this point. I wish I could be more assertive in finding this contribution. I just hope we'll find a way to live on and take what we live together to be happier and better people. I love you, I admire you, and I think we will find a way to be a positive influence on each other's life regardless.
Aug 15, 2014, 8:34 PM - Sonia Maria: We will find a way. You are very special to me. And right now, you are right, these intense emotions and their effect on my ability to communicate with you have not subsided either. We just need time. If you do feel any further confusion or need more clarity on where we stand (I'm also telling myself this), please just let me know. I will do the same. And I don't know when we will be speaking next, so take care and I really hope you have an amazing and enlightening time at BM.
Aug 15, 2014, 9:00 PM - Sonia Maria: Kerouac quote: "the only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars." 

This describes people like us.
Aug 16, 2014, 12:22 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: This quote gets me to the border of tears every time. It gets me so close to how I feel about life and people I want to love and feel close to. There are difficulties to bring our perspectives together but in the end I *know* we feel the same about life, and we are just trying to make it all work for both of us. This is hard, but it's hard regardless. I love you. Burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars.

Thank you Sonia.
Sep 1, 2014, 9:31 AM - Sonia Maria: Franc. You need to call me as soon as you wake up. This is in reference to your email. I have a huge interview tomorrow. I need to speak with you and let you fully grasp what you have done to me. And I need to share this with you before I continue my day and begin preparing for this interview. So, again, call me.
Sep 1, 2014, 10:32 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Sonia, I just woke up (7am here). Are you sure this is a good idea? I'm not sure talking will help either you or me. At this point we may just be hurting each other more than it's necessary. But if you say it definitely needs to happen, let me shower and get coffee and I'll call you.
Sep 1, 2014, 10:32 AM - Sonia Maria: Yes. Call me.
Sep 1, 2014, 10:33 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Ok, give me a few minutes
Sep 5, 2014, 12:52 PM - Sonia Maria: Is there a feasible way to erase you from my life? Please assist me in doing so when you find a motherfucking answer. This is torturous to hear. Bear with me, I'm disappearing from your life soon. 95% there.
Sep 5, 2014, 12:53 PM - Sonia Maria: That last stretch is the hardest.
Sep 5, 2014, 12:57 PM - Sonia Maria: And you're probably thinking "wow what a child to be messaging me this". But think about it, you're a man on the brink of 30 years old incapable of making a decision about being in an incredible relationship.
Sep 5, 2014, 12:57 PM - Sonia Maria: You don't even need to respond
Sep 5, 2014, 12:57 PM - Sonia Maria: I just need to let this shit go.
Sep 5, 2014, 1:12 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Sonia, I don't understand. I thought the last time we spoke it was clear that we were over. We stated there was not going to be any revision. If it wasn't clear, it was not obvious to me. You were very explicit, and I think I was too on my email. If there is something else you are waiting an answer to, I am unaware of what it is and Im sorry. I really wish we could avoid hurting each other more. I dont understand what you expect from me. I wish things would have gone a different way.
Sep 5, 2014, 1:13 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: What is torturius to hear?
Sep 5, 2014, 1:14 PM - Sonia Maria: Yeah, you're email. That's what did it.
Sep 5, 2014, 1:16 PM - Sonia Maria: My main issue is, why did we engage in something like this
Sep 5, 2014, 1:16 PM - Sonia Maria: It was so clear you never wanted this
Sep 5, 2014, 1:16 PM - Sonia Maria: It's driving me mad
Sep 5, 2014, 1:16 PM - Sonia Maria: Constant doubt from the beginning
Sep 5, 2014, 1:17 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Thats so not true. You can't say I didnt want it.
Sep 5, 2014, 1:17 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I really wanted it, I wanted it to work and be great.
Sep 5, 2014, 1:17 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I believed in it, and it took time later on to accept that things were different
Sep 5, 2014, 1:17 PM - Sonia Maria: I mean fucksake, you complained about my age, my interests and that went into a downward spiral of you not wantingne
Sep 5, 2014, 1:18 PM - Sonia Maria: I want you to admit this
Sep 5, 2014, 1:18 PM - Sonia Maria: Because it's true
Sep 5, 2014, 1:18 PM - Sonia Maria: No. I don't believe that anymore
Sep 5, 2014, 1:18 PM - Sonia Maria: You're false in my mind
Sep 5, 2014, 1:19 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: None of my friends has seen me as excited as they've seen me with you.
Sep 5, 2014, 1:19 PM - Sonia Maria: Everything I'm saying is real. You never believed in me
Sep 5, 2014, 1:19 PM - Sonia Maria: No dude
Sep 5, 2014, 1:19 PM - Sonia Maria: Just admit it
Sep 5, 2014, 1:19 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: And yes, there were factors that made me question it
Sep 5, 2014, 1:19 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: And we fucking brought those up
Sep 5, 2014, 1:19 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Its not a conspiracy of some sort Sonia
Sep 5, 2014, 1:20 PM - Sonia Maria: I don't understand why you came into my life. You were the first man who made me think it was ok to let myself go. But you didn't fucking want me!
Sep 5, 2014, 1:21 PM - Sonia Maria: And I hate that I shared myself with you
Sep 5, 2014, 1:21 PM - Sonia Maria: I hate that you know things about me
Sep 5, 2014, 1:21 PM - Sonia Maria: It fucking digs deep into my soul
Sep 5, 2014, 1:21 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I did want you. Why would I have done all that time w you?
Sep 5, 2014, 1:21 PM - Sonia Maria: That you know things about my father
Sep 5, 2014, 1:21 PM - Sonia Maria: You're insecure and unsure of your life
Sep 5, 2014, 1:21 PM - Sonia Maria: That's why
Sep 5, 2014, 1:21 PM - Sonia Maria: You needed a crutch
Sep 5, 2014, 1:21 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: And why is it so bad that you shared things w me?
Sep 5, 2014, 1:21 PM - Sonia Maria: And that was me.
Sep 5, 2014, 1:22 PM - Sonia Maria: Because you're not worthy of knowing !!!!!!!!!!!&
Sep 5, 2014, 1:22 PM - Sonia Maria: That's fucking why
Sep 5, 2014, 1:22 PM - Sonia Maria: And you exist
Sep 5, 2014, 1:22 PM - Sonia Maria: Knowing all my of deep secrets
Sep 5, 2014, 1:22 PM - Sonia Maria: And I hate that you know
Sep 5, 2014, 1:22 PM - Sonia Maria: I hate it.
Sep 5, 2014, 1:23 PM - Sonia Maria: You're jot worthy of knowing.
Sep 5, 2014, 1:23 PM - Sonia Maria: *not
Sep 5, 2014, 1:23 PM - Sonia Maria: You didn't want me as anything long term
Sep 5, 2014, 1:24 PM - Sonia Maria: You just needed someone
Sep 5, 2014, 1:24 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I dont understand why you would share anything with me then, if it was so conditional
Sep 5, 2014, 1:24 PM - Sonia Maria: To feel better about yourself
Sep 5, 2014, 1:24 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I dont know where this is going
Sep 5, 2014, 1:24 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: This is just not true
Sep 5, 2014, 1:24 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: And nothing I can say will convince you
Sep 5, 2014, 1:24 PM - Sonia Maria: Because you fucking put a  facade that you wanted me to open myself to you
Sep 5, 2014, 1:25 PM - Sonia Maria: But you were doubtful the whole time
Sep 5, 2014, 1:25 PM - Sonia Maria: It's true.
Sep 5, 2014, 1:25 PM - Sonia Maria: I'm speaking true facts. Just super unfiltered
Sep 5, 2014, 1:26 PM - Sonia Maria: The whole fucking time. You were unsure. And I was real and I told you I'm letting you in.
Sep 5, 2014, 1:26 PM - Sonia Maria: And that digs deep into my fucking heart and soul
Sep 5, 2014, 1:27 PM - Sonia Maria: I forgive you though. You are a part of my past
Sep 5, 2014, 1:28 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: The fact that I dont think our relationship would go well doesnt make everything fake. You are a person I love and that adds to my life. Thats there all the time.
Sep 5, 2014, 1:29 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: It does not follow that a relationship will work no matter what
Sep 5, 2014, 1:29 PM - Sonia Maria: Franc. You just did not communicate and you need to fucking admit an error
Sep 5, 2014, 1:29 PM - Sonia Maria: You still sorb.
Sep 5, 2014, 1:29 PM - Sonia Maria: Don't
Sep 5, 2014, 1:29 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I did fucking admit that error a thousand times
Sep 5, 2014, 1:29 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I did
Sep 5, 2014, 1:29 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I did
Sep 5, 2014, 1:30 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: You just won't take it
Sep 5, 2014, 1:30 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: You want to hurt me, now
Sep 5, 2014, 1:30 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Thats whats happening
Sep 5, 2014, 1:30 PM - Sonia Maria: No I don't at all
Sep 5, 2014, 1:30 PM - Sonia Maria: You just fucking cut me so deep
Sep 5, 2014, 1:30 PM - Sonia Maria: And I'm losing myself
Sep 5, 2014, 1:30 PM - Sonia Maria: And I don't know what to do
Sep 5, 2014, 1:30 PM - Sonia Maria: I was strong in the beginning
Sep 5, 2014, 1:30 PM - Sonia Maria: But why did you do this?
Sep 5, 2014, 1:30 PM - Sonia Maria: I don't fucking know.
Sep 5, 2014, 1:31 PM - Sonia Maria: It's incredible how little I knew you
Sep 5, 2014, 1:31 PM - Sonia Maria: In this relationship
Sep 5, 2014, 1:31 PM - Sonia Maria: Who you were
Sep 5, 2014, 1:31 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Im just so sorry ... I really wish things were different
Sep 5, 2014, 1:31 PM - Sonia Maria: What you get
Sep 5, 2014, 1:31 PM - Sonia Maria: What you felt*
Sep 5, 2014, 1:32 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I dont know if thats true
Sep 5, 2014, 1:32 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I did bring things up
Sep 5, 2014, 1:32 PM - Sonia Maria: That's all you can say "I'm sorry". How funny, fucking human existence is. Something is literally torturing someone's mind. Meanwhile, the counterparty had no issue and just says "I'm sorry."
Sep 5, 2014, 1:33 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: If I didnt go deeper was probably because I felt it would be really difficult to talk about anything
Sep 5, 2014, 1:33 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: It doesnt matter anymore
Sep 5, 2014, 1:34 PM - Sonia Maria: Obviously not, to you haha.
Sep 5, 2014, 1:34 PM - Sonia Maria: I'm so disappointed in you
Sep 5, 2014, 1:34 PM - Sonia Maria: In this
Sep 5, 2014, 1:35 PM - Sonia Maria: To this day, what troubles my mind. Why did you let me in
Sep 5, 2014, 1:35 PM - Sonia Maria: Why did you let me fall
Sep 5, 2014, 1:35 PM - Sonia Maria: For all of your on the surface shit
Sep 5, 2014, 1:35 PM - Sonia Maria: I don't get it.
Sep 5, 2014, 1:36 PM - Sonia Maria: You're not a bad person, you are just not aware of yourself.
Sep 5, 2014, 1:36 PM - Sonia Maria: And maybe BM helped you
Sep 5, 2014, 1:37 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I didnt think I was doing that. I thought we were both letting each other in.
Sep 5, 2014, 1:37 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I also thought
Sep 5, 2014, 1:37 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: As you were sharing important stuff about yourself
Sep 5, 2014, 1:38 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: That you felt comfortable with me
Sep 5, 2014, 1:38 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: And it must have felt nice to have somebody to talk to about it
Sep 5, 2014, 1:38 PM - Sonia Maria: No. It's about the quality of person
Sep 5, 2014, 1:38 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Its difficult to understand why you feel so betrayed on that
Sep 5, 2014, 1:38 PM - Sonia Maria: I do feel betrayed
Sep 5, 2014, 1:39 PM - Sonia Maria: YOU let me in while YOU were feeling doubt
Sep 5, 2014, 1:39 PM - Sonia Maria: You should NOT have done that
Sep 5, 2014, 1:39 PM - Sonia Maria: Simple.
Sep 5, 2014, 1:39 PM - Sonia Maria: Communicate the doubt do I DONT share my fucking deep pain inside
Sep 5, 2014, 1:40 PM - Sonia Maria: Do you understand now?
Sep 5, 2014, 1:40 PM - Sonia Maria: Grasp that
Sep 5, 2014, 1:40 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I understand now. I have a different idea about sharing pains, but I understand its important for you to feel safe before sharing.
Sep 5, 2014, 1:41 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Thats all I can say
Sep 5, 2014, 1:41 PM - Sonia Maria: I forewarned you
Sep 5, 2014, 1:41 PM - Sonia Maria: Wow.
Sep 5, 2014, 1:41 PM - Sonia Maria: Ok.
Sep 5, 2014, 1:41 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I should have warned you I was feeling doubts
Sep 5, 2014, 1:41 PM - Sonia Maria: YES.
Sep 5, 2014, 1:41 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Whenever I felt them
Sep 5, 2014, 1:41 PM - Sonia Maria: YES.
Sep 5, 2014, 1:41 PM - Sonia Maria: Get it now.
Sep 5, 2014, 1:41 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: So that you didnt share if you didnt think it was worth the risk
Sep 5, 2014, 1:41 PM - Sonia Maria: Yes.
Sep 5, 2014, 1:42 PM - Sonia Maria: You were not worthy of sharing if you were in doubt of being with me
Sep 5, 2014, 1:42 PM - Sonia Maria: Get it???)?
Sep 5, 2014, 1:42 PM - Sonia Maria: THIS is why it hurts
Sep 5, 2014, 1:42 PM - Sonia Maria: I fucking exposed
Sep 5, 2014, 1:42 PM - Sonia Maria: Myself
Sep 5, 2014, 1:42 PM - Sonia Maria: To someone
Sep 5, 2014, 1:42 PM - Sonia Maria: Who was unsure of being with me.
Sep 5, 2014, 1:42 PM - Sonia Maria: Not with someone
Sep 5, 2014, 1:42 PM - Sonia Maria: Who actually
Sep 5, 2014, 1:42 PM - Sonia Maria: Wanted to be a part of my life.
Sep 5, 2014, 1:43 PM - Sonia Maria: Do you understand now?
Sep 5, 2014, 1:43 PM - Sonia Maria: The pain
Sep 5, 2014, 1:43 PM - Sonia Maria: It's deep
Sep 5, 2014, 1:43 PM - Sonia Maria: Understand please
Sep 5, 2014, 1:43 PM - Sonia Maria: So I can let you fucking go.
Sep 5, 2014, 1:44 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: As Im telling you, I still hope one day to be part of each other life. Thats why the sharing makes sense to me no matter what. But I do understand how you see it.
Sep 5, 2014, 1:44 PM - Sonia Maria: Hah.
Sep 5, 2014, 1:45 PM - Sonia Maria: Franc, these feelings of absolute disgust in you will subside
Sep 5, 2014, 1:45 PM - Sonia Maria: However
Sep 5, 2014, 1:45 PM - Sonia Maria: In terms of you being a part of my life
Sep 5, 2014, 1:45 PM - Sonia Maria: I see you
Sep 5, 2014, 1:45 PM - Sonia Maria: As another man
Sep 5, 2014, 1:45 PM - Sonia Maria: Who ruined me
Sep 5, 2014, 1:45 PM - Sonia Maria: And it's an extensive list
Sep 5, 2014, 1:46 PM - Sonia Maria: And listen
Sep 5, 2014, 1:46 PM - Sonia Maria: I'm not a negative person
Sep 5, 2014, 1:46 PM - Sonia Maria: You brought me laughs, joy, love
Sep 5, 2014, 1:47 PM - Sonia Maria: But, you also managed to hit me where it hurts the absolute most
Sep 5, 2014, 1:47 PM - Sonia Maria: I forgive you already
Sep 5, 2014, 1:47 PM - Sonia Maria: But this level of pain
Sep 5, 2014, 1:47 PM - Sonia Maria: I have never felt
Sep 5, 2014, 1:47 PM - Sonia Maria: Because I have never exposed myself to someone
Sep 5, 2014, 1:47 PM - Sonia Maria: As I did with you
Sep 5, 2014, 1:47 PM - Sonia Maria: And I need you to wrap your head around that
Sep 5, 2014, 1:47 PM - Sonia Maria: To understand why
Sep 5, 2014, 1:47 PM - Sonia Maria: You will never be a true part of my life
Sep 5, 2014, 1:47 PM - Sonia Maria: Again.
Sep 5, 2014, 1:48 PM - Sonia Maria: And it hurts
Sep 5, 2014, 1:48 PM - Sonia Maria: A whole fcking lot. And I know my pain
Sep 5, 2014, 1:48 PM - Sonia Maria: You  don't feel it
Sep 5, 2014, 1:48 PM - Sonia Maria: Which also hurts
Sep 5, 2014, 1:48 PM - Sonia Maria: Doubly
Sep 5, 2014, 1:48 PM - Sonia Maria: Massive amounts of pain
Sep 5, 2014, 1:49 PM - Sonia Maria: Which is why
Sep 5, 2014, 1:49 PM - Sonia Maria: I wish
Sep 5, 2014, 1:49 PM - Sonia Maria: I could erase you
Sep 5, 2014, 1:49 PM - Sonia Maria: It's not worth it
Sep 5, 2014, 1:49 PM - Sonia Maria: I have so much ahead of me in my life.
Sep 5, 2014, 1:50 PM - Sonia Maria: All these weak men keep bringing me down
Sep 5, 2014, 1:51 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I unnderstand your pain Sonia, and it hurts like was mine, trust me. Because yiu enteres my life and I didnt think I was fucking up so bad and now I feel like everything I was excited about I ruined more than I could have imagined possible
Sep 5, 2014, 1:51 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I dont feel your pain like you
Sep 5, 2014, 1:51 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: But I do care about you, and the fact that all this pain
Sep 5, 2014, 1:52 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Will prevent us from ever even being close again or knowing about each other
Sep 5, 2014, 1:52 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I just dont know how to think that
Sep 5, 2014, 1:53 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: But ok, you need to completely erase me from your life, I get it
Sep 5, 2014, 1:58 PM - Sonia Maria: Your words. Are like air to me now. Especially when you speak deeply about things. Fucking hell, the worst.

And that's it. I will not message you again. I'm sorry for even messaging you in the first place. You're probably off with someone else not giving an actual fuck. And that's fine. I don't even care about that. Do you.   


I just wish there was  some way, some way I could take all of this back. I don't live in regret. But, wow. I regret this. 


And, again. It's not because you're a bad person. You just don't know what the fuck you want. 


I just wish you hadn't dragged me into your life of uncertainty. Because, look at me now. Messaging you like this.


I may have gone too far. Do I care? No. You deserve to hear every word.
Sep 5, 2014, 2:00 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Well I do care. But I dont think this is helping neither of us at all.
Sep 5, 2014, 2:01 PM - Sonia Maria: Haha. I know, you've brought out a fucking beast in me.
Sep 5, 2014, 2:02 PM - Sonia Maria: I'm over this.
Sep 5, 2014, 2:03 PM - Sonia Maria: It's horrible. And you're horrible for doing this shit.
Sep 5, 2014, 2:03 PM - Sonia Maria: Goodbye Franc
Sep 5, 2014, 2:12 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Goodbye Sonia
Sep 5, 2014, 2:30 PM - Sonia Maria: Also, I forgot. if you happen to run into me, please do not come near me or acknowledge me. I don't want anything to do with you.
Sep 5, 2014, 2:30 PM - Sonia Maria: And that's my final stab. Take care.
Sep 5, 2014, 2:38 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I hope you take care too. I wish you well.
Sep 14, 2014, 6:46 AM - Sonia Maria: Franc, this is honestly honestly the last you will hear from me. As you know,  this situation has caused me indescribable amounts of pain, which will be eventually subside. I am more than sure of this. I just want to know, and I want you to be honest with me, as transparent as possible... While at BM, did you meet someone? Did you find someone who you think will actually be able to help you so that you are able to overcome all these obstacles within you? You know, even if you don't tell me the truth, I really hope you did. I really hope you find someone who is able to lift and push you forward, which I clearly was unable to do. I think I just want this question answered so I can have more closure and move forward. These past few weeks have been rough as I ultimately feel betrayed by you. I keep attacking you, looking for answers. You always reciprocate so mildly which shows you didn't really value this as I did. I think is the fundamental disconnect between us. Anyway, I want to know. I think knowing you have someone else will force me to move forward. I'm just lost and deeply hurt, which is why I rant and go crazy and overreact and spiral out of control. If you could just tell me something solid and be honest, I would appreciate it.
Sep 14, 2014, 6:56 AM - Sonia Maria: No matter how vengeful and angry I feel towards you, I still love and care so deeply. I really do hope that you gain strength and are able to manage being with someone. I deserve someone who is already fully capable of doing this. I know that I will never be with you again. I know that I will be with someone who is truly able to value me. That's not the point of me asking you if you have someone else or not. As I mentioned, it's because I just need more closure in this situation. That's why you can be brutally honest. That's all.
Sep 14, 2014, 7:21 AM - Sonia Maria: And, lastly, I'm sorry for all of my hurtful words these past few weeks. I am so sad that my mind is filled with negative thoughts, just a massive block sitting there. Because of this relationship. It tears me up inside. I don't mean to hurt you. I'm a good person. But I also don't take back anything I said to you. It's sad because I know that you actually don't fully comprehend what has happened. Or you are choosing not to confront it.
Feb 21, 1:17 PM - Sonia Maria: You don't have to call me back. It isn't urgent. I just had a weird, intense night. You were basically the beginning/middle of it. 
And I just wanted to share it. The morning after effect.
I'm still a little in awe of how smoothly I was able to communicate with you.
It must have to do with your  physical presence around me.
Anyway, in terms of you and I speaking, it can be in months or maybe even years. I don't really care. I'm happy it's there and how much I have (selfishly) learned from it all.
And that's it.
Take care.
Feb 21, 2:21 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I am also positively surprised on how smoothly we could communicate. It was a strange, intense night for me too. I guess there is a lot going on.
I think it would be good that we find a day soon to talk, now that we've communicated again. I'd like to talk like yesterday at least once, with a clear head, and make sure we're learning from this the right way.
Feb 21, 2:22 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: But it can be in some more time if you think that's better.
Feb 21, 2:23 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Anyway, I agree that there is a lot we can grow by learning from this, even if hasn't been easy.
Feb 21, 2:58 PM - Sonia Maria: I was very much in a state of self progression, isolation, and total focus on myself, my psyche. 
But tonight, after our conversation and the occurrences that followed (which is why I called, because I was confused), I realized there's a space in me that needs to be filled with also focusing on the progression of another. And maybe it's my heightened sense of empathy that makes me feel this way. Or that I'm hyper sensitive, I don't know.
But anyway, you injected that back in me. And it's a positive thing.
So yeah, I guess I'll follow up as to when. I know I'm ready to discuss as I've told you my analysis on you, "us", reached exhausting levels.
Just a matter of right time and place.
Feb 21, 3:14 PM - Sonia Maria: Also I am not trying to suggest that gap to be filled is meant to be with you.
Feb 21, 3:14 PM - Sonia Maria: To be clear...
Feb 21, 5:13 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I understand. I share some of those feelings too. Let me know when you feel it's a good time for us to chat. No rush.
Feb 21, 9:14 PM - Sonia Maria: :)
Feb 22, 10:39 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: :)
Feb 25, 6:46 PM - Sonia Maria: Also, unrelated to anything mentioned above.
I liked your music form Ana's farewell. Just turned on this set and thought I'd share if you haven't heard of it as it's totally your vibe:

Feb 25, 9:39 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Thank you Sonia, I just started listening and it is totally my vibe. Also, very happy you enjoyed the music on Friday.
Feb 25, 10:34 PM - Sonia Maria: :) !! Yeah it's a great mix
Feb 25, 10:34 PM - Sonia Maria: End to end
Feb 25, 10:35 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Still listening to it now :)
Feb 25, 10:36 PM - Sonia Maria: Felt a need to circulate it to someone who would fully appreciate
Mar 12, 1:45 PM - Sonia Maria: Random. But last night I had a weird dream of you and me messaging to meet up, talk, and paint a mural on a wall (we were deciding where).
I guess that means we should meet up and talk at some point if you're still down haha.
Mar 12, 1:45 PM - Sonia Maria: Also, hello hope all is well hah
Mar 12, 3:43 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: :) Whenever you want. Do you want to find some time next week?
Mar 12, 5:45 PM - Sonia Maria: Yep, let's do it! I only have plans for Thursday so far, then free. Let me know what works for you.
Mar 12, 9:16 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I think Tuesday is the best day for me. Would that work?
Mar 13, 7:56 AM - Sonia Maria: Tuesday works for me. Let's be in touch the beginning of next week. Have a good weekend!
Mar 16, 3:12 PM - Sonia Maria: Hey. May have to reschedule as it seems I'll be working late majority of this week. Hectic right now. Will be able to confirm later today.
Mar 16, 3:57 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Ok, no worries. Let me know
Mar 16, 9:12 PM - Sonia Maria: Hey. So I actually will be free tomorrow, but around 8 or so
Mar 16, 9:13 PM - Sonia Maria: Let me know if that's too late
Mar 16, 9:57 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Yeah, 8 should work well for me.
Mar 16, 9:58 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Where would you want to meet?
Mar 16, 10:01 PM - Sonia Maria: Would you want to get diner? Or just drinks.
I've been to Catfish recently  and loved it, would be down but you're vegetarian and menu is mainly meat based. So up to you.
Mar 16, 10:02 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Catfish works great for me actually, I can handle some fish. So there at 8?
Mar 16, 10:05 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Or a bit later if thats better for you
Mar 16, 10:19 PM - Sonia Maria: 9 would be better so I wouldn't be too rushed.
Mar 16, 10:19 PM - Sonia Maria: Ok with you?
Mar 17, 8:52 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Yeah that works!
Mar 17, 8:53 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Sorry I missed the msg last night
Mar 17, 9:27 AM - Sonia Maria: Np, see you later
Mar 17, 7:20 PM - Sonia Maria: hey, I'm taking the G to bedford nostrand stop. Want me to pick you up and we can walk there? If you'll be home that is. I'm heading back to Wburg now
Mar 17, 7:32 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Ok! I just got home
Mar 17, 7:32 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Come by whenever
Mar 17, 7:42 PM - Sonia Maria: Cool, I'll let you know when I'm on my way
Mar 17, 8:01 PM - Sonia Maria: Heading now
Mar 17, 8:39 PM - Sonia Maria: Outside. Don't know if you just planned to meet me down here but do you actually mind if I step in and use your toilet?
Mar 18, 12:04 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Good, and bad, and difficult, and peaceful, and challenging, and relieving, and inspiring at the same time.
Mar 18, 12:25 AM - Sonia Maria: Incredibly windy.
Please listen to the album Shades of Blue by Madlib when you have the chance.
It's brilliant.
Was great to meet with you.
Have a good night :)
Mar 18, 10:04 AM - Sonia Maria: Oh i totally missed you message
Mar 18, 10:05 AM - Sonia Maria: Yeah just a massive whirlwind of emotions, really. I felt the same
Mar 18, 10:25 AM - Sonia Maria: I also don't to pressure you at all, so take as much time as you need.
But it would be nice to keep some form of communication/contact. It was nice spending time with you.
Mar 18, 11:04 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: Yeah, it was really nice. It was great seeing you so well.
Mar 18, 11:05 AM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I will need some time though. I am honestly unsure of what I'm feeling right now.
Mar 18, 11:16 AM - Sonia Maria: I understand.
Mar 18, 12:58 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I don't mean to say that I don't want to communicate. I do! I would actually enjoy spending time with you. But this all has been very emotionally taxing and I need to figure out what would be best. But I'm very happy we're back in touch.
Mar 18, 2:51 PM - Sonia Maria: I know, I understood it in this way :)
Mar 18, 2:52 PM - Sonia Maria: Take your time. And I also won't be offended if you decide it's too much for you
Mar 18, 2:52 PM - Sonia Maria: I would prefer we don't bring in any negativity in each other's lives.
Mar 28, 6:01 PM - Sonia Maria: Sorry. Out of curiosity. Do you have our whatsapp chat history saved, like even when I went absolute psycho on you?
Mar 28, 6:01 PM - Sonia Maria: Up to now..
Mar 28, 6:07 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: I should have it, yes
Mar 28, 6:08 PM - Franc Camps-Febrer: How are you?
Mar 28, 6:15 PM - Sonia Maria: Do you mind emailing? I just need more documentation from last year haha. Sounds a bit odd but I'm just writing more.
And I'm good :). Busy with work, but good. How are you?
